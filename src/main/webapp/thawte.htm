      <p>You may be interested in signing or encrypting email. You can do this using an X.509 certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA). Outlook, Apple Mail, Mozilla and other mailers support X.509 certificates.</p>
      <p>With no significant effort, you can obtain  free certificates from Thawte <a href="http://www.thawte.com/html/COMMUNITY/personal/index.html">here</a>. The only &quot;identity&quot; initially associated with those certificates is your email address, not your name. If you would like to associate your name with a Thawte email certificate, and thus confer more legal authority to email sent with it, you must have your Thawte identity  notarized. </p>
      <p>As a Thawte <a href="http://www.thawte.com/html/COMMUNITY/wot/index.html">Web Of Trust </a> Notary, I can issue 35 points towards your identity assertion. My domestic partner Ron Lussier (see <a href="http://lenscraft.com/thawte/">here</a>) can issue another 10 points. You need a total of 50 points to associate your name with your certificate. </p>
      <p>If you've already scheduled an identity assertion, please bring the following items with you: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Two forms of ID with the following properties:
            <ul>
              <li>One must be the ID you used to establish your Thawte identity,</li>
              <li>At least one must be a picture ID, and </li>
              <li>At least one must be government-issued.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Two photocopies of both IDs , front and back. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3><strong>Appointment required </strong></h3>
      <p>Please email me at <a href="mailto:dan-at-greening.name">dan&#064;greening.name</a> to schedule an appointment. This will allow us to set up a time when my partner and I are both available. 45 points in one stop! </p>
      <p>I will not notarize drop-ins. </p>
      <h3><strong>Note on Social Security numbers </strong></h3>
      <p>I will <strong>not accept </strong> Social Security cards (or any ID containing a social security number as an identifier). Do you really want to trust a stranger with this information? (If the answer is yes, why are you interested in securing your email when you're willing to compromise your identity in the process?) </p>
      <h3><strong>Location </strong></h3>
      <p>I live in Sausalito with Ron. We're located at 67 Crescent Ave, Sausalito CA 94965. Click <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?ed=U_BZyep_0TrZ72By_gwo3nC5z9ve5B.X&csz=sausalito,+ca&country=us">here</a> for a map. </p>

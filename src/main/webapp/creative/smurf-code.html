A word about the code: The smurfcode was developed painstakingly by
*very*small*, *blue*, *cute*little*creatures* called Smurfs, organized
into a maternal botherhood called the Smurf Gang.  Smurfs are
*loveable*, *cuddly* beings who *love* to be *squeezed*
ever-so-gently.  They especially like *blueberry*ice*cream*.  They
occasionally ring *cute*little*bells*.  And they just want to be
*your*friends*.  </p><p>

Certain smurfs are particularly good at defending Canada against
invaders, marketing Smurf products, presiding over vice, acting very
innocent or pompous, describing the historical value of Smurfs,
howling at the moon, speaking in Smurf Lingo (Smurf's up!), etc.
Since Smurfs and their *friends* have so many varied qualities, we
have devised a *really*neat* method for uniquely identifying them.
Furthermore, since Smurfs and Bears now intermingle frequently, the
Smurfcode is deliberately orthogonal to Bearcode version 1.7.
Characteristic letters from both systems may be intermingled to form a
Smurfurr code or a Bluebear code.  </p><p>

The most obvious characteristic of a Smurf is its giggle, so we
logically begin there.  Using a capital "S" to denote "SMURF", we have
added a sub-class characterizing silliness, which combines a smurf's
tee-hee, chortle, guffaw, and overall humor qualities, unambiguously
numbered 0 to 9 as follows:  </p><p>

        0 - (Little/no humor, or incredibly sparse)  We're talking
            Mona Lisa here.  One would never mistake such a meager
            smile for a smirk.  Postings from these Smurfs are
            invariably serious, though they take undisplayed joy in
            humorous postings by others.  </p><p>

        1 - (VERY slight smirk)  This is the kind of smirk people
            display when they want to signal to other Smurf's that
            they MIGHT be a Smurf.  No raised eyebrows appear.  No
            erect tongue-in-cheek.  Usage indicates probable closet
            smurf.  </p><p>

        2 - (Smirk)  This unmistakable characteristic indicates an
            unabashed delight in the silliness of others, but may
            indicate non-participation.  These Smurfs never post
            original, humorous articles on their own, but they may,
            rarely, followup with a smart-remark.  </p><p>

        3 - (Tee-hee)  A giggle in all respects, but very quiet.  </p><p>

        4 - (Laugh)  Occasionally makes light fun of self or others,
            particularly friendly others.  Enjoys a good joke.  </p><p>

        5 - (Chortle)  Makes light fun of self or others.  </p><p>

        6 - (Chortle Plus)  Makes light fun of self, world, or others.
            Has been known to laugh at PSAT, SAT, GRE, GMAT test or
            final exam questions, during the examination period.  </p><p>

        7 - (Guffaw or Meep)  Can make fun of most things, including
            obnoxious people or situations.  </p><p>

        8 - (Snort)  Loves to make fun of anything.  This can border
            on bad-taste, but appreciators abound.  </p><p>

        9 - (Snort with Acrobatics)  Intrusively humorous in finding
            fun.  Wildly ridiculous, often ignored or disliked.
            Zany.  Wacky.  </p><p>

Using this scheme, one can narrow a creature down to a subclass,
though occasional intractables fall between two classes.  The end
result is left to the creature classifying.  One may use a hybrid
designation for those who vary across time (example: S0/9).  The
number closest to "S" indicates the most probable state.  </p><p>

Negative numbers indicate complainers, largely negative numbers
designate frequent whiners or complainers.  Combinations of negative
and positive numbers can appear.  </p><p>

----------------  Other SmurfCODE(TM) Classifiers  ------------------  </p><p>

While humor is a big part of little smurfs, other things even them
out.  Please note that smurfs are not necessarily twinks.  However,
since so *many* smurfs *are*, we have incorporated some twink
associated characteristics.  </p><p>

</p><ul>
<li>         b -     Color of Blue.  Typically an indicator of one's
                affiliation with the official Smurf Gang.

<li>                g    A sweet smurf (smiles, can laugh, makes your day
                     a *nicer* one).
</li><li>                g+   Definite hint of maple sugar.  Even Smurfs get
                     tickled here.
</li><li>                g++  Saccharin (550 times sweeter than sugar).  A

                     Softener Bear.
</li><li>                g-   Ascerbic, chilly whit, but tolerable, as long as you

                     usually kept under control.

                     can do here is use it and throw it out, cause ya know,
                     "She's an...  airhead!..."
</li><li>                y-   Not twinkie-like at all.  In fact, just a tad too serious.

                     coal up THAT one and get a diamond).
</li><li>                y/   Doesn't look like a twinkie, but has a definite peroxide
                     smell on the inside.

<ul>

                may seem, Smurfs originated in France, but can often
                speak fluent valley (San Fernando, not Loire).
<ul>

</li><li>                v++     Get on your like way rad stick and get outta

</li><li>                j--     Jokes are un-PC.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>  <p>


In cases where you are guessing, append "?".  In cases where you are
obfuscating the truth, use ":".  In cases where the particular
attribute is as good as a prototype, use "!".  </p><p>

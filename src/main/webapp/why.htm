<p>&ldquo;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an
act, but a habit.&rdquo; Aristotle.</p>
<p>Good social bonds and organizations make us happier and more
effective. I've devoted much of my life to finding ways to strengthen
and leverage relationships using computers. The first company I founded,
Chaco Communications, built tools for simulated environments, where
people could meet online. We built a kids' environment called <a
	href="http://www.nttdata.co.jp/release/1997/0731.html" target="ext">Magnet
Chat</a>, featuring Hello Kitty and friends, for NTT Data and Sanrio in
Japan. Chaco morphed into LikeMinds, which used similarities between
people to adaptively recommend movies, music and books (used for the <a
	href="http://www.netflix.com" target="ext">Netflix</a> recommender, and
now shipped with <a
	href="http://www.ibm.com/Search?v=11&lang=en&cc=us&q=likeminds&Search.x=33&Search.y=11&Search=Search%2Bbutton"
	target="ext">IBM WebSphere</a>). I helped with a product called Aria,
which aggregated traffic information to show usage patterns when
millions of people visit a web site. I created a company, BigTribe
Corporation, which used geographic proximity information to help bring
people together. I am helping <a href="http://www.citrixonline.com">Citrix
Online</a> organize into highly transparent, agile teams; everyone knows
what others are doing, and we work to clear the way for their progress.
I'm very interested in networks of individuals, how those networks
structure our lives, and how computers can help.</p>

<p>I love people, and I have over 3000 people in my contacts list. I
also love computer science, which requires me to carve out time to
ignore people. Spam is a problem, and for me the danger is both
commercial spam and personal spam. With many people in my network, the
effects of forwarded jokes or online polls can be overwhelming. My
solution is to insist that friends follow this rule: They may send me
anything that they wrote themselves. They may forward one funny email
per year. No online polls! The intended effect of this rule is to force
people to be more creative rather than derivative.</p>
<p>I love the outdoors. I grew up in <a

	target="ext">rural Michigan</a>, where teenage summers found me
hoisting an aluminum canoe to the nearby Pine River and paddling around,
catching carp and frogs, watching dragonflies zoom and mate, swimming in
Honeyoye Creek and collecting sheep bones. I wanted to assemble a full
spinal column, but the vertebrae didn't come from the same sheep, so I
could never make it work. Winters found me cross-country skiing, and
bicycling my way through a snowy 4 mile paper route (OK, my parents
helped).</p>
<p>In my twenties and thirties, I got more wide-ranging. I
backpacked Denali, Yosemite, White Mountains of New Hampshire, Isle
Royale, Baja California, Sequoia, Olympic National Park and the North
Cascades. While living in Los Angeles, I bought a junky Jeep, named it
&ldquo;Big Fella,&rdquo; unbolted the hardtop, pulled off the doors and
drove around in sunglasses. While at a Complex Systems summer school at
the Santa Fe Institute, I drove Big Fella up the rugged Pipeline Drive
in Los Alamos. If I wasn't a skinny geek, I actually might have looked
cool.</p>

<p>I met my husband, Ron Lussier, when he offered, on a gay college
activities email list, to take people caving. I offered to take him
backpacking in return. A long, email-based relationship started there,
finally meeting at the second Lesbian and Gay March on Washington,
October 11, 1987. Ron took me caving in a muddy, winding West Virginia
cave called McClung's. I took him backpacking in the Grand Canyon, with
friends Li-Whei Chen, Doug Trainor and Alen Amirkhanian. Many caving and
backpacking trips with Ron ensued. After moving all over the country,
not necessarily in synchrony, Ron and I moved in together in 1991. I
love Ron because he's got a wild-streak, he's very creative, and, well,
he's handsome and charming.</p>
<p>I still play outside, but it's more time-limited. I like to
snowboard in the winter, hike in the summer. I like to day-hike and
mountain bike, but time hasn't allowed much of that. I dream about
backpacking, but mostly I'm remembering the good times I had with my
friends.</p>
<p>I love experiencing and creating art. My mother is an artist,
calligrapher, graphic designer and former art professor. I grew up
creating plaster sand castings, paintings, paper cutouts, picture books
and weavings. I love complex, dramatic, curiosity evoking paintings,
photography and calligraphy. Some of my favorite works, which either Ron
or I own, are shown in this page.</p>

<p>One of my favorite art creations was Sherry Lewis Shrine, an
installation Ron and I built for Burning Man 1998. This 8&times;16 foot
puppet theater invited visitors to create their own puppets or put on a
puppet show. Such contributions would be rewarded with a Bombay Sapphire
Martini. We videotaped most of the puppet shows. We developed a complete
branding campaign. The logo featured Lamb Chop, the puppet, holding a
Martini glass. We produced and distributed brochures outlining the
purpose of the shrine and recounting Shari Lewis's life. We created
wooden coins that could be used to defer or trade Martini compensation.
The logo appeared in huge form on all four sides of the theater, on the
brochures and on the coins. On one the last day of Burning Man, our
installation was protested by the <a
	href="http://www.drue.com/burnt/burnt12.html">Sock Liberation Front</a>.
They shouted &ldquo;Save the Socks, Save the Socks!&rdquo; and demanded
that people take off their socks. Participants then disappeared into the
semi-autonomous tribal area between Black Rock Desert and San Francisco.
</p>
<p>I am fiscally conservative. I believe governments (and people)
should have money before they spend it, but also think governments
should tax citizens to pay for common benefits. At the same time, I
believe strongly in individual freedoms. This does not make me a
libertarian: I fear the <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy
of the Commons</a>. Government and corporate management serve best by
preventing local greed from destroying common wealth, while
simultaneously encouraging creativity and industry.</p>
<p>I tend not to believe what politicians say, but watch what they
do. The majority of us now agree with my early assessment of George W.
Bush, who spewed comforting drivel and left us with an
impossible deficit, primarily resulting from his $1.5 trillion 10 year
tax cut. I loved Bill Clinton, because he reversed decades of deficit
spending. Too bad some people think sexual fidelity distinguishes a good
leader. Of course, I love our current, intelligent President.</p>

<p>At times I've been active in civic and university governance. In
1995, I was elected President of the University of California Student
Association--the student government body for all 9 UC campuses--where I
led some efforts to divest the UC portfolio of South African stocks.
Ultimately we succeeded, with the adoption of a UC Regents resolution in
1986 to divest interests in South Africa. I wrote part of the Regents'
resolution. Combined with efforts at other universities, we motivated
the US Congress to pass the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act September
9, 1986 over President Reagan's veto. The Act prohibited U.S. trade and
other economic relations with South Africa. These efforts may have contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa.</p>
<p>When I ran for UC Student Association President in 1985, some
students voted against me solely because I was gay. Discrimination is
rapidly abating, an outcome I couldn't have imagined at that time. In
most states and communities, lesbians and gays now live comfortable,
open lives free of most overt discrimination. Regarding inheritance taxes, medical visitation rights and
adoption law, gay couples continue to face special hurdles. </p>
<p>Ron and I have been together since 1987, but legal recognition for us has been a roller coaster. 
We married when it became recognized in
a US state, Massachusetts, in 2004. We live primarily in California. California briefly considered us married in 2004, then this was overturned, then in May 2008 the
California Supreme Court ruled that our marriage was legal, then in late 2008 California voters took our marriage away with proposition 8, then in 2009 the California Supreme Court ruled marriages that were legally performed in-state (ours was out-of-state) were legal, then October 2009, Senate Bill 54 grandfathered in our out-of-state marriage.</p>
<p>Ron and I spend more time than we should, making legal arrangements to
compensate for discriminatory laws. It's a big hassle.  It seems unfair that Ron cannot
inherit my estate tax-free, may be prohibited from visiting me in an out-of-state
hospital, and may not be able to decide my treatment when I'm
incapacitated. Married couples automatically receive these benefits. We have to compute our taxes as both married (in state) and not-married (federal). It makes
traveling to certain states risky.</p>
<p>In summary, my life has consistent themes: I love people,
computers and networks. I am very persistent, even in the face of substantial opposition. I seek situations where I can test ideas about
how people can work better together. I'm a researcher and
experimentalist: for example, these web pages used the most advanced
HTML stylesheet features I could get away with when I designed them in
late 2002. I am an entrepreneur. I hope you like me!</p>

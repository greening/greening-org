<div id="title">Thawte Identity Assertion</div>
<div class="body">
<p>You may be interested in signing or encrypting email. You can do
this using an X.509 certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA).
Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird and other mailers support X.509
certificates.</p>
<p>With no significant effort, you can obtain free certificates from
Thawte <a
	href="https://www.thawte.com/secure-email/personal-email-certificates/index.html">here</a>.
The only &ldquo;identity&rdquo; initially associated with those
certificates is your email address, not your name. If you would like to
associate your name with a Thawte email certificate, and thus confer
more legal authority to email sent with it, you must have your Thawte
identity notarized.</p>
<p>As a Thawte <a
	href="https://www.thawte.com/secure-email/web-of-trust-wot/index.html">Web Of
Trust </a> Notary, I can issue 35 points towards your identity assertion. My
husband Ron Lussier (see <a href="http://lenscraft.com/thawte/">here</a>)
can issue another 30 points. You need a total of 50 points to associate
your name with your certificate.</p>
<p>If you've already scheduled an identity assertion, please bring
the following items with you:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Two forms of ID with the following properties:
	<ul>
		<li>One must be the ID you used to establish your Thawte
		identity,</li>
		<li>At least one must be a picture ID, and</li>
		<li>At least one must be government-issued.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Two photocopies of both IDs , front and back.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Appointment required </strong></h3>
<p>Please email me at <a href="mailto:dan-at-greening.org">dan&#064;greening.org</a>
to schedule an appointment. This will allow us to set up a time when my
partner and I are both available. 65 points in one stop!</p>
<p>I will not notarize drop-ins.</p>
<h3><strong>Note on Social Security numbers </strong></h3>
<p>I will <strong>not accept </strong> Social Security cards (or any
ID containing a social security number as an identifier). Do you really
want to trust a stranger with this information? (If the answer is yes,
why are you interested in securing your email when you're willing to
compromise your identity in the process?)</p>
<h3><strong>Location </strong></h3>
<p>I live in Sausalito with Ron. We're located at 89 Crescent Ave,
Sausalito CA 94965. Click <a

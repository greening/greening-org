/Text1 (part because ICE is mainly a protocol with a little bit of data, while most XML standards focus solely on data. ICE doesn't even specify the format of the syndicated content data. In XML terms, it's ju\
st bytes inside an ice-item entity. The character data inside an ice-item can be structured using one of the industry-specific XML data repre-sentations-BizTalk, Rosetta-Net, Com-merce---One, WDDX, and\
 so on. Other standards efforts are often placed in the same box with ICE, because Web publishing is only now becoming automated. The World Wide Web Consortium's Resource Description Framework  RDF  an\
d related standards specify how descriptive terms can be attached to content files, allowing content to be identified and selected according to a filtering or sort criteria. These frameworks can be use\
d together with ICE, letting subscribers select offers using complex criteria. The syndicate/subscribe model ICE defines is almost the same as what computer scientists call  publish/subscribe.  And it \
turns out that ICE is most similar to binary publish/subscribe protocol standards, such as CORBA and DCOM. But in ICE, messages are delivered through XML, typically delivered over an HTTP connection, a\
s opposed to a lower-level binary protocol. ICE is much easier to read and use, but it is also much more verbose. If you're constrained by network bandwidth, either compress the ICE packets or use some\
thing else. Finally, ICE defines many typical syndication operations and constraints that CORBA and DCOM leave to vertical industry implementations. ICE provides only minimal security and access-contro\
l facilities. Typically the HTTP transport layer handles security, using such technology as SSL. Access control is handled on the syndication server, which performs authentication through the usual Web\
 server password-access system, and provides different subscription offers to different subscribers. Request-Response The ICE protocol defines a set of request-response pairs coded in XML. The ICE stan\
dard doesn't specify the underlying transfer protocol, but does suggest an implementation using the HTTP POST /response mechanism called  ICE /HTTP . The body of the HTTP POST contains the ice-request,\
 and its associated HTTP response contains the ICE response. As far as I know, all current ICE implementations use ICE/HTTP. This article assumes ICE/HTTP is the transport. Every ice-request is contain\
ed within an ice-payload, which identifies the ICE version and the sender, and provides a request-id. Listing One shows a sample request payload. Most of the header is devoted to debugging infor-mation\
. Upon receiving a request, the respondent creates a response payload, which contains whatever the subscriber asked for, if available. The response payload contains many of the same header tags as the \
request payload. Catalog Before syndication can occur, the syndicator must configure a syndication server, specifying which offers are available to which subscribers at what time. Figure 1 shows a synd\
ication console that lets a syndicator add and delete catalogs, offers, delivery policies, and subscribers. For a subscriber to know what content it can subscribe to, it needs to obtain a catalog of of\
fers from the syndicator. This can be handled in two ways: In the old-fashioned way, the subscriber telephones the syndicator, asks  What's available?  and the syndicator provides a list. In the modern\
 ICE way, the subscriber sends an ice-get-catalog request to the syndicator, which responds with a collection of offers and offer-groups.  Listing Two shows an example ice-get-catalog request, followed\
 by a response. The ICE catalog first provides contact information for a person who can provide more details on the catalog. Then it provides a set of product offers. Each offer includes the name of th\
e content and the copyright owner. It can also include several typical usage constraints: atomic-use indicates that all items in the subscription must be offered to the user, otherwise individual items\
 may be deleted from the presentation. Editable indicates the subscriber )

/Text3 (future access to  hot news.  ICE can automate the delivery process. Packages have several other attributes drawn from typical syndication requirements. Some of the fields are the same as ice-offer fiel\
ds. These fields modify the package only, while the ice-offer fields refer to the entire subscription. A number of parameters that appear on the offer can also appear on the package entity-expiration, \
Atomic-use, Confirmation, Editable, Fullupdate, showcredit, and Exclusion. For example, the Miss Manners column might have an exclusionary clause that the article can't be used unless the author's pict\
ure is displayed. Package Sequence ICE forces packages to be processed in the order specified by the syndicator. The state of a subscriber can be defined by a single value-the package sequence identifi\
er  PSI . Each package sent has the  old PSI   the required subscriber state prior to receipt of the package  and the  new PSI   the state of the subscriber following receipt of the package. Prior to s\
ubscribing, the subscriber is in the  empty state  indicated by "ICE-INITIAL". If it doesn't matter what the previous state was, a package can be sent with "ICE-ANY" as the PSI. Using sequence IDs redu\
ces or eliminates the state information stored on the syndicator side. Subscription management becomes the purview of each subscriber. The syndicator has to remember a subscriber's state only if it sup\
ports push delivery. PSI strings are opaque to the subscriber, except when they need to be compared for equality. This gives the syndicator enough flexibility to use an implementation-specific state en\
coding. For example, the implementation might use integers, time stamps, or a proprietary database key as the PSI. National Semiconductor offers thousands of complex parts through distributors and reta\
ilers. By syndicating product information through ICE, National's distributors can provide the most up-to-date product information to customers. Syndication is very handy for such vendors. Listing Thre\
e shows an example subscription item from the Na-tional Semiconductor XML catalog. Ice-item 1333 appears in the beginning, an XML description for part 100301. Figure 3 shows the same item integrated in\
to a distributor's Web page. It's tempting to say this article describes the tip of the iceberg, but ICE is a fairly simple standard. Most of the ICE features omitted in this article relate to error ha\
ndling and offer negotiation. For more details on ICE or vendors providing ICE applications, refer to the boxes titled  ICE Standardization  and  ICE Resources.  Conclusion The ICE standard makes it ea\
sier for syndicators to deliver information in a controlled way to subscribers. In traditional publishing, writers, artists, composers, and producers  outsource  contract and delivery issues to syndica\
tors, allowing the artisans to focus on their craft. Syndicators then achieve economies of scale by performing the same function for multiple artisans. Some Web companies follow this traditional model.\
 iSyndicate, for example, assembles content from individual Web pages, packages it, and allows portals to subscribe. If you're an author, it's easy to publish your material through iSyndicate. Using IC\
E, portals will be able to eas-ily subscribe to syndicated content from iSyndicate. As usual, the Internet changes traditional definitions, because it makes automated negotiation possible and speeds in\
formation transfer. Syndication is no exception. On the Internet, a syndicator can be anyone with a large collection of uniformly structured data made available to multiple subscribers. This means part\
s manufacturers, icon collections, free software aggregators, stock-photo libraries, and even Web-traffic analyzers can be syndicators. Now that the Web has matured, and people seek useful information \
among too much noise, obtaining the best-quality information for your visitors becomes more challenging. Typically, this means subscribing to, assembling, and controlling multiple sources of news and d\
ata. The ICE protocol makes it possible for site developers to do this )

t indicates that the subscriber must display the copyright owner with the content. Usage-required indicates that information regarding viewers of the content must be provided to the syndicator. Other c\
onstraints can be encoded in a mutually agreed upon format and offered in a constraints-url. Offers can be built in to a display hier-archy for convenient navigation using ice-offer-group tags. A subsc\
riber can't subscribe to an ice-offer-group; the name of the offer-group is only a mnemonic. Subscriptions are made using the name in the ice-offer tag, even if they are embedded inside an ice-offer-gr\
oup. There are four offers shown in Listing Two: Comic:Daily:Bonko Dog and Me, News:Continuous:-Events, Local:Art:Daily:Burning and Local:Art:----Daily:Electro-lumin--e-scent. The last two are organize\
d under the Local:Art hierarchy. Delivery Policy With every offer is a set of delivery policies, including the delivery-mode, availability dates, and more detailed availability information. Content can\
 be delivered in pull or push mode. If the subscriber specifies pull delivery, the subscriber always makes the requests and the syndicator always responds-content is delivered only when the subscriber \
requests it. Pull delivery makes programming a subscriber quite simple: You get what you ask for when you want it. Push delivery, on the other hand, requires the subscriber to run a Web server to handl\
e pushed deliveries, which come in the form of an HTTP request from the syndicator. The HTTP request could contain a large payload with one or more articles. The subscriber usually confirms with an OK.\
 There are some fairly complex rules for specifying when and how often a subscriber obtains new content from a subscription. In Listing Two, Bonko Dog and Me can be pulled at most once per day  maxcoun\
t=-"1"  between midnight  starttime="00:00:00"  and 4:00am  duration="P14400S" specifies 14400 seconds from starttime . Subscribing To subscribe to an offer, the subscriber simply sends an ice-offer ba\
ck to the syndicator in an ice-request. The offer is usually taken verbatim from an ice-catalog. The subscriber can modify any field marked negotiable in an ice-catalog. If the syndicator responds with\
 OK, then the negotiated offer is accepted. If the syndicator responds with Sorry, it was rejected with no further information. If the syndicator responds with a different ice-offer, the subscriber can\
 con-sider it a counteroffer, and submit it back to the syndicator as an ice-request, fairly confident it will be accepted. A catalog of ice-offers can be presented  the old-fashioned way,  by sending \
offer information not through an ice-catalog, but rather via the Web, email, fax, or voice. People who process subscriptions then click on offers of their choosing or cut-and-paste to subscribe. Figure\
 2 shows an example Web-page catalog from the National Semiconductor subscription site  ice.national.com . In this case, it is a  catalog of catalogs : It contains various National Semiconductor catalo\
gs to which my site can subscribe. The NSC Product Folders #1 XML  subscription, for example, presents product information in XML on every National Semiconductor product. Clicking on an offer establish\
es a subscription. Packages To fulfill subscriptions, the syndicator sends directives in an ice-package to update a subscriber from an old-state to a new-state. ice-item, ice-item-ref, and ice-item-gro\
up entities specify additions, and ice-item-remove entities specify deletions. If a package includes an activation field, the subscriber must not perform the operations before the specified time. For n\
ews items, this is typically a release time. A business might want earnings news released after the stock market closes. A politician might want a speech transcript released after a press conference. N\
ews editors tend to respect these time constraints, in part to ensure )

/Text (Newspapers, product retailers, and Web portals face a common problem: How can they provide the most up-to-date content? They can invest in developing their own original content, as does Web Techniques \
magazine, or they can assemble material from several outside sources and rebrand it under their own name. The San Francisco Chronicle newspaper assembles its comic page by buying comic strips from King\
 Features and Marvel. Wyle Electronics creates product-information Web pages by assembling data sheets from electronics manufacturers. Excite buys news from Reuters and UPI. Checkout.com buys movie, mu\
sic, and game information from All Media Guide and offers it along with DVDs, CDs, and games in an online store, creating an  entertainment buying experi-ence.  Providing the best possible information \
on products in a timely fashion is an important form of customer service. All other factors being equal, customers tend to shop with retailers that give the best presale product information. This is fo\
rcing online retailers to become information portals where consumers can go to find out more about products  and incident-ally, buy those prod-ucts . But the retailers don't have the best information-m\
anufacturers do. They have the greatest incentive to create highly informative product collateral-presale bro-chures, specifications, manuals, and rebate coupons-to help customers buy and use a product\
. If manufacturers syndicate collateral on the Internet and let retailers subscribe to it, customers can obtain enormous detail on a product before and after the sale. With syndication, online retailer\
s should have a great advantage over brick-and-mortar stores, where maintaining detailed product information is very costly. The Problem At present, online syndicators usually provide content through p\
roprietary or roll-your-own solutions. Some subscribers assemble and rebrand syndicated content by placing links to a syndicator's Web site. Others perform a nightly download from syndicator FTP sites.\
 And sometimes syndicators create and maintain Web sites under different names  kind of an inverted syndication  to which the subscribers can safely link. These ad hoc forms of syndication are fraught \
with technical problems. Usually a subscriber is assembling material from several syndicators. On the subscriber side, adding content from a new syndicator involves engineering and Web-design effort. O\
n the syndicator side, every new subscriber has to be trained to use the syndication system, deployment becomes much more dependent on high--demand Web skills, and in the end customers usually get less\
 information. Ad hoc approaches typically require human involvement to negotiate the simplest operational issues. Does the subscriber have to credit the author or syndicator? Can the syndicator push th\
e content at a particular time of day? Can the subscriber edit the material? Is there an incremental charge for each piece of content? Can the subscriber download only some of the content offered by th\
e syndicator? In short, without a standard protocol, syndication doesn't scale very well on the Web. ICE Syndication To address these problems, a consortium of application server and content companies,\
 led by Vignette, created a standard syndication protocol based on XML-Information and Content Exchange  ICE . XML is a simple standard to represent data--hierarchies using familiar HTML-style tags. Th\
e ICE protocol standardizes the following functions:    A potential subscriber requests a catalog of subscriptions offers.   A syndicator responds with a subscription---offer catalog, each offer detail\
ing the type of content, usage restrictions, and available delivery methods, times, and frequencies.   A subscriber subscribes to one or more offers, negotiating for specific delivery methods and times\
.   A subscriber pulls a package of subscribed content from a syndicator.   A syndicator pushes a package of subscribed content to a subscriber.   A syndicator or subscriber cancels or changes a subscr\
iption. Related Standards ICE is one of the most innovative uses of XML, in )

/Text (ICE is truly a demand-driven standard. Vignette recognized the need for a syndication protocol, but quickly realized it had to obtain wide industry adoption to make it work. It sought syndication-softw\
are vendors  including competitors , syndicators, and subscribers to participate in an ad hoc standards group. Most were part of an advisory council; the active core became the ICE Authoring Group.  An\
y syndication protocol would fail if it didn't address the needs of end users, so the ICE Authoring Group decided that syndicators and subscribers should comprise a minimum of 50 percent of the partici\
pants. No new vendors could join unless there were enough new end users to provide a balance. The result is a standard shaped and driven by market need.  Some of the first ICE applications were surpris\
ing. Despite the participation of large news syndicators in the standardization effort, the first apps came from manufacturers who used ICE to publish parts catalogs. These companies continue to push t\
he boundaries of the ICE standard heavily. One vendor, Arcadia Technologies, is now building ICE tools and middleware specifically for parts catalogs.  Andromedia adopted ICE for a unique purpose: synd\
icating and subscribing to Web visitor events. Andromedia's network monitors sniff packets, plug in to Web servers or application servers, and then syndicate the results through the ICE protocol. Web-t\
raffic analyzers and personalization servers that adapt to visitor behavior are ICE subscribers, and on occasion they are ICE syndicators as well. Andromedia standardized on ICE to let partner companie\
s easily integrate new dynamic content servers, event monitors, and analyzers with its products.  Although the ICE standardization group remained ad hoc until the standard was -nearly complete, it need\
ed a formal organization to promote the standard and approve changes. It selected an organization centered around publishers, the Graphics Communication Association, rather than a Web- or computer-cent\
ric group. The advantage is that users exert greater control than engineers; however, a possible disadvantage is that the standard may not undergo rigorous technical evaluation. -DG)

    <h1> Dan Greening, PhD</h1>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>I have been the leading force in dramatically turning around two mid-sized software engineering departments and a state lobbying organization—all three heading for or in the abyss—by improving internal communication, culture and processes. These organizations became highly productive with my help. I love doing this.</p>
    <p>I have  been CEO, CTO and VP Engineering of software startups, with two reasonable successes. I have been Principal Investigator on two National Science Foundation SBIR grants. I have a credential collection: UCLA PhD in Computer Science, Certified Scrum Practitioner, Certified Product Manager. I've been published in research and trade journals, speak at conferences, etc. I have a blog on agile enterprises.</p>
    <p>I am an operational manager who thinks strategically, and who loves software development, research and people. Because both process engineering and corporate profitability interest me, I have contributed in other areas, including marketing, finance, HR, internationalization, operations and customer support.  I am comfortable working at all levels of an organization, including in corporate board meetings, strategic analysis and decision-making, product, program, department and team management, and working directly with individual contributors. While compensation and intellectual challenge are my strongest motivators, my ability to increase corporate profitability has depended  on my authority. In  environments where the CEO can see and exploit the work that I do, I have contributed more effectively and rapidly and advanced as a result. </p>
    <p>I am well-compensated and well-regarded in my current position, but broader influence and advancement may be limited due to organizational constraints.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p> My background is broad; Google me or find more here.  I am  formally trained primarily in computer science (software) and computer  engineering (hardware), with a bit of statistical mechanics (physics). I  have studied business organizations by doing it.<br />
      <br />
      I have been a serial entrepreneur, software engineering manager, writer,  organization re-engineering consultant, researcher and social activist.  These activities tie together, and a credo emerges: People organized  well, working in partnership with computers, can achieve great things.<br />
      <br />
      I am currently helping reorganize engineering and product management in a  mid-sized internet software enterprise to be much more effective and  responsive.  Engineering and marketing can explore markets together to  rapidly identify opportunities and build successful products. Software  ventures can stumble upon success, but deliberate, timely action can  produce results more reliably.<br />
      <br />
      As you read this, I am in the kitchen trying to perfect the secret  sauce. Several burners are on, there is steam everywhere, people are  yelling and running every which way. My apron is covered with different  foods. We are all working in harmony amidst this chaos. Life is good. </p>

      </div>
      <p> Public Company; Computer Software industry </p>
      <p> October 2007                                      – Present                                  (3 years) </p>
      <p> At Citrix Online, my team facilitates the efficient and  iterative delivery of high-value projects to customers. Our mandate is  to promote high-productivity, not only in engineering, where we report,  but throughout the company. <br />
        <br />
        Citrix Online uses Scrum to organize most engineering, some marketing,  and some customer support work. Scrum focuses on teams of 9 people or  less; to make a multi-product agile company, we needed something much  bigger. <br />
        <br />
        in 2008Q4, I developed, and now evangelize and manage, a highly agile  approach to organize our 200 person engineering and product management  work, which we call Enterprise Scrum. It drives agile principles  throughout Citrix Online. A paper on this work appears in 2010 IEEE  Hawaii Intl Conference on System Science. This system allows us to adapt  more rapidly to emerging market conditions than other mid-to-large  engineering groups can.<br />
        <br />
        Citrix Online's user experience design and testing group indirectly  reports to me. This sophisticated group works iteratively to design,  prototype and test user interactions; it seeks simple and highly  intuitive interfaces. When people say &quot;I love Citrix Online products,  because they are so easy to use,&quot; we can credit this group and its  people.<br />
        <br />
        Citrix Online uses many continuous improvement techniques: Scrum, XP,  Kaizen, Theory of Constraints. We like Net Present Value for  prioritizing work. Our group researches, packages and evangelizes these  decision-making and organizational processes for Citrix Online. <br />
        <br />
        Citrix Online has highly-scalable, fault-tolerant network-based  applications using Java web, infrastructure and streaming components,  Flash/Flex, HTML and Javascript clients, C++ clients.  We create and  refine continuous build, unit testing, integration testing, performance  testing and rapid deployment mechanisms all the time. <br />
        <br />
        I was a primary catalyst in transforming Citrix Online to the highly agile company you see today. </p>

This work centered on  high-performance VLSI circuit placement algorithms (on AIX), and  provided guidance on how to tune simulated annealing algorithms to  maximize quality and speed.  Part of my work was ultimately incorporated  into IBM's production circuit placer (on VM/CMS). I also contributed to  porting X11R5 (windowing system) to AIX </p>

        <p> Developed new techniques for parallelizing simulated annealing,  an algorithm used for placing transistors and circuits on chips.  Developed theory for control of calculation errors in &quot;lazy&quot; parallel  simulated annealing that still drives simulated annealing to  convergence.  This work was largely sponsored by IBM T.J. Watson  Research Center. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Dan provided Scrum training to our development team  and it was amazing.  What is unique about Dan is that he has been an IT  leader for more than 2 decades, so he has seen all kinds of different  methodologies for managing the development process.  He is able to draw  on that deep experience to explain the strengths and weaknesses of Scrum  relative to other processes, and can help to tailor it to a group's  individual needs.  Since he has seen so much, he also isn't entranced by  the 'fad' aspects of Scrum, and gets right to the heart of what it can  do for your business.&rdquo; August 21, 2008</p>

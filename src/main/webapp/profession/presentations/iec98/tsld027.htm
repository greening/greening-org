The information revolution is integrating the supply chain and creating more data.  That creates an opportunity for marketers to better target products and personalize marketing messages.  Because marketers, even direct marketers, are getting extremely low response rates, doing better targeting and personalization can improve revenues by millions or billions of dollars.
</ul><ul>
Because LikeMinds technology identifies and leverages intrinsic taste information that has been expressed by purchases or behavior, LikeMinds can generate more accurate targeting and personalization.  And that leads to a higher top line, and a higher bottom line for you.
</ul><ul>
LikeMinds technology lends itself to a new concept, many-to-one marketing, which leverages the power of community to generate higher revenues and loyal consumers.
</ul><ul>
LikeMinds technology has applications both on the web and off, using purchase information and other behavior patterns.
</ul><ul>
When you are trying to provide goal-based personalization, such as searching web pages for a keyword, use objective filtering, Bayesian networks, or learning agents.  When you want to leverage consumer taste information for higher revenues, use LikeMinds.</ul> </p>

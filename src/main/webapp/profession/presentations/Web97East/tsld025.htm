  <hr> <p> <ul>
Here are some interesting bullet points about our technology.
</ul><ul>
LikeMinds employs the first collaborative filtering system ever developed.  John Hey, one of the founders of LikeMinds, patented this system back in 1987, before the web made its debut. He and we have been refining it ever since.  You can compare MovieCritic to any competitor, and we do a much better job.
</ul><ul>
LikeMinds technology supports both explicit ratings, tracked web behavior, and purchase behavior.
</ul><ul>
LikeMinds handles the cold start problem:  it can make good recommendations even if no one else has rated products.
</ul><ul>
Because we understand parallel processing, LikeMinds WebSell and DirectSell scale to millions of products and millions of users.
</ul><ul>
We also understand and have products in development to support many-to-one marketing, where we bring likeminded people together, then market products to a whole group.  We think this will create a marketing revolution, when the world is ready for it.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Seasoned startup leader, inventive computer scientist, accomplished salesperson,
    published author.</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>LikeMinds, <em>Chief Technology Officer<br>
    </em>April 1997 to present</h3>
    <p><font size="3">In 1997, I co-founded a new company called <a href="http://www.likeminds.com/">LikeMinds</a>, incorporating people, software, and
    patents from Chaco and Songline Studios.&nbsp; LikeMinds builds market forecasting and
    personalization software for web sites, direct marketing programs, and consumer product
    assortment planning.&nbsp; LikeMinds technology is collaborative, meaning that we identify
    similarities between people or stores to predict what marketing efforts will succeed in
    the future.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">At LikeMinds, I patented several algorithms related to marketing,
    collaborative filtering, categorization, and clustering.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I lead the engineering team...</font></p>
    <h3>Chaco Communications, Inc., <em>President</em> Nov 94-present</h3>
    <p>Co-founded a company to produce multimedia network games and collaboration software. We
    have been profitable since incorporation with zero initial capital, using contracting
    revenue to bootstrap development of our products. I negotiate all contracts, obtain
    business services, and develop business and marketing plans. </p>
    <p>Chaco now gains all its revenues through OEM and direct licensing of its virtual
    community products. Chaco's VR Scout VRML viewer has been rated best by many independent
    sources, including San Francisco Chronical and C|NET. </p>
    <h3>Novell, Inc., Cupertino, CA<br>
    <em>Director, Frameworks and Tools</em> Mar 93-Oct 94</h3>
    <p>I managed C++ frameworks and GUI-builders teams. I had direct hiring and budget
    authority. We were highly-leveraged through contracts with Visual Edge, GUILD,
    WordPerfect, and KaseWorks, all involving joint development. </p>
    <p>Novell and Borland built a portable C++ framework called ObjectWindows (OWL) for
    AppWare Foundation. I was technical director, managing staff from Novell and Borland. </p>
    <p>All projects required inter-company diplomacy: contract negotiations, motivating
    mixed-loyalty personnel, obtaining and conserving resources. I frequently visited key
    customers and gave conference presentations. The AppWare Foundation division was
    originally a startup (Software Transformation, Inc). I helped sell STI to Novell. </p>
    <p>I designed many C++ classes, including reference-counting and data-structures
    templates. I do it for fun, though some have invaded our products. I use Borland 4.0 C++
    and Microsoft Visual C++, Symantec C++ 7.0, GNU C++ and Lucid C++, on Windows, Mac, Unix.
    I write code on airplanes, primarily; no other time available. </p>
    <p>Although I would never do it as a primary job, I am an expert Unix system
    administrator, having configured and used Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, AIX, UnixWare, BSD386,
    Linux, OSF/1.2 on 10base2, 10baseT, SLIP, PPP, and NetWare networks. </p>
    <h3><em>Project Leader, UNIX</em>, Mar 91-Mar 93</h3>
    <p>Novell's AppWare Foundation is a graphical-user interface toolkit which runs on
    X11/Motif, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh. The group I led designed and wrote the
    X11/Motif version of this toolkit. I implemented a system for loading a complete
    widget-hierarchy from a resource database, among several other parts of the system. I
    subclassed several Motif widgets. </p>
    <p>I hired 4 senior engineers. When I left the group, I promoted one to replace me. </p>
    <h3>IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY<br>
    <em>Student Research Staff Member</em>, May 89-Feb 91, May 88-Sep 88</h3>
    <p>Studied circuit placement and parallel simulated annealing (see publications).
    Determined relationship between calculation inaccuracies and annealing convergence (a
    longstanding open problem). Experimented with annealing on an IBM ACE/RT 8 processor
    machine. Filed an invention disclosure for parallel VLSI placement technique. A program I
    developed was merged into existing IBM production code: it provided a graphic interface,
    and resulted in speedups of up to 3.4. </p>
    <h3>Software Transformation, Inc., Santa Monica, CA<br>
    <em>Senior Software Engineer</em>, Nov 88-May 89</h3>
    <p>Designed graphics library for X-windows, MS Windows, and Macintosh. (Company moved--see

    publications). Headed 5 person design team for a matrix-rotation arithmetic chip. Designed
    and laid-out 24-bit signed-digit divider circuit. Headed 4 person system administration
    team for 27 HP 9000 workstations. Taught <em>Computer Science Theory</em>: Turing
    hierarchy, complexity theory, etc. </p>
    <h3>University of California Student Association, Sacramento, CA<br>
    <em>President (elected)</em>, May 85-Jun 86</h3>

    <p>Space limitations prevent me from describing many experiences in detail: I spent two
    months at the MIT Lab for Computer Science, modeling the performance of a butterfly
    switching circuit for a large dataflow computer (using Markov techniques). I attended the
    Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School in 1990 (complex systems: fractals,
    chaos, spin-glasses, Navier-Stokes fluid flow equations, neural networks, genetic
    algorithms, natural selection, mathematical epidemiology, etc.) I have ported many
    public-domain software packages to a wide-variety of machines, including several
    incarnations of X-windows, TeX, NNTP, Magic, etc. I have configured Domain name-servers,
    YP (Yellow Pages) servers, and NFS (Network File System) for several variants of UNIX. I
    have written large graphics-oriented programs for the X11 windows platform. If curious,
    ask. </p>

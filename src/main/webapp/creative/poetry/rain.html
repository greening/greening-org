<h1>tao te ching rain</h1>

<p>I would shatter your image to ice crystals<br>
cold and beautiful<br>
the fruit of dormant trees<br>
waiting out seasonal disaster. </p>

<p>Your voice would be the song of the clouds<br>
flashing and violent<br>
the words of patient moisture<br>
waiting out long periods of silence. </p>

<p>I would localize your destruction<br>
to a brief moment of passionate<br>
absence,<br>
a diversionary touch of unfulfilled lust. </p>

<p>But your influence is pervading and persistant<br>
as the waters from the sky<br>
freeze and shatter boulders to sand<br>
wash through mountains wearing rocks to pebbles. </p>

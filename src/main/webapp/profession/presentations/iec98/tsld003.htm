  <hr> <p> <ul>
There&#146;s a trend happening in the retail industry today.  History buffs will recognize it as a trend that has been happening everywhere since the industrial revolution.  That trend is &#147;supply chain integration.&#148;
</ul><ul>
Capitalism drives business  toward companies offering cheaper, higher quality goods and services when consumers want them (I.e., now).
</ul><ul>
Before widely networked computers, the supply chain responded slowly to changes in consumer demand. Economies of scale created areas of functional specialization, such as manufacturers, distributors, retail chains, retail stores, and consumers.
</ul><ul>
However, as intranets, extranets, and the internet made consumer demand information more available, the entire supply chain could become more responsive to changing market conditions.  Those areas of specialization are becoming more integrated: hence supply chain integration.
</ul><ul>
Retail stores now share point-of-sale transaction data with manufacturers.  Consumers now buy products directly from distributor web sites rather than retail store intermediaries.  The result: greater efficiency, better understanding of consumer needs, better service, and lower prices.</ul> </p>

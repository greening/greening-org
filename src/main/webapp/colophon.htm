<p>A colophon is an inscription placed at the end of a book or manuscript containing
  facts about its production. This site has some unique features worth mention.</p>
<p>Viewed with a CSS2 compliant browser&#8212;such as Netscape 7.01, Mozilla
  1.2, Opera or Phoenix 0.5&#8212;this
  site has a fixed navigation bar on the left. If you visit the <a href="why.htm">Why?</a> page
  you can see it in action:  scroll down and watch the nav bar.
  Mozilla leaves it always visible, helping you move from page-to-page
  wherever
  you scrolled. 
   Because Microsoft Internet Explorer
  6 does not implement &quot;fixed positioning,&quot; it scrolls the nav bar
  off the screen. I used a  stylesheet trick to make
  IE consider the nav bar &quot;absolute&quot; while more advanced browsers consider
  it &quot;fixed&quot;.</p>
<p>CSS2-compliant browsers will  show the first paragraph of each page without
  indent. I implemented this with another CSS2 feature, pseudo-class :first-child.
  Again,
  IE users will not see this.</p>
<p>I tried to create a highly readable font scheme. The navigation aids&#8212;nav
  bar, title, header lines&#8212;are
   rendered in a bold sans serif font, usually Arial. The body text is rendered
  in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28font%29" target="ext">Georgia</a>,
  a font designed for screen pixels. Georgia's dropped numerals lend interest
  to the text and serifs improve fatigue-free
  readability at small point sizes. </p>
<p>If you are using Netscape, Mozilla or Opera, you may not see Georgia
  correctly rendered. In the string &quot;96&quot;, the 9
  should drop below the 6. If not, your text is  likely rendered in Times New
  Roman. Try downloading and installing Georgia from <a href="fonts/Georgia.zip">here</a>,
  extract the 4 TrueType files into a temporary directory, then drag them to
  the Fonts control
  panel. Why does it work automatically in IE? Because I instrumented this site
  to download Georgia if not already on your computer. That behavior is standard
  in CSS2, but only IE supports it.</p>
<p>I designed this site for screens with 800&times;600 pixels or more.
  However, even old browsers
should
present this site acceptably.</p>
<p>The site is designed for low-bandwidth and fast rendering. This page's 
  source file contains no  format information, which consumes bandwidth.
  Instead, they link to shared stylesheet and font files. &lt;p&gt; tags inside
  the &lt;div.body&gt; block
  get rendered in Georgia, with the spacing you see here. &lt;p&gt; tags inside
  the &lt;div.nav&gt; block
  get rendered in Arial, with no inter-paragraph space. This reduces bandwidth
  requirements, because your browser downloads the stylesheet only
  once for
  many pages. </p>
<p>All modern browsers should display the title and body text rapidly and before
  the navigation bar, rather than waiting for the whole page to load. That is
  because this site uses &lt;div&gt; tags with absolute positioning
  to separate major page components, rather than &lt;table&gt; tags.</p>
<p>The <a href="contact.htm">Contact</a> page refers to a vCard that can be
  downloaded directly into most contact managers. That vCard required some configuration
  of MIME types on Apache
    2.0 web server, which at least partly explains why more people don't put
  vCards on their web sites.</p>
<p>This site was developed with  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver
    MX</a>, a professional web design
  tool produced by my former employer, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com" target="ext">Macromedia</a>.
  Fonts were encoded using Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/weft3/default.htm?fname=%20&fsize=">WEFT</a>.
  The site uses the XHTML 1.0 Transitional language, making it XML compliant.</p>

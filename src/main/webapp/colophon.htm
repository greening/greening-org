<div class="body">
<p>A colophon is an inscription placed at the end of a book or
manuscript containing facts about its production.</p>
<p>Viewed with a CSS2 compliant browser, this site has a fixed
navigation bar on the left. You can see it in action: scroll down and
watch the left navigation column. Modern browsers leave it always
visible, helping you move from page-to-page from wherever you scrolled.
Because Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 does not implement &ldquo;fixed
positioning,&rdquo; it scrolls the nav bar off the screen. I used a
stylesheet trick to make IE consider the nav bar &ldquo;absolute&rdquo;
while more advanced browsers consider it &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>CSS2-compliant browsers will show the first paragraph of each
page without indent. I implemented this with another CSS2 feature,
pseudo-class :first-child. Again, IE6 users will not see this. Indented
paragraphs might seem &ldquo;old school,&rdquo; but I think it makes
reading easier.</p>
<p>I chose a highly readable font scheme. Navigation aids&#8212;nav
bar, title, header lines&#8212;are rendered in a bold sans serif font,
usually Arial. Body text is rendered in <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28font%29" target="ext">Georgia</a>,
a font designed for screen pixels. Georgia's dropped numerals lend
interest to the text and serifs improve fatigue-free readability at
small point sizes.</p>
<p>You may not see Georgia correctly rendered. In the string
&ldquo;96&rdquo;, the 9 should drop below the 6. If not, your text is
likely rendered in Times New Roman. Try downloading and installing
Georgia from <a href="fonts/Georgia.zip">here</a>, extract the 4
TrueType files into a temporary directory, then drag them to the Fonts
control panel. Why does it work automatically in IE? Because I
instrumented this site to download Georgia if not already on your
computer. That behavior is standard in CSS2, but only IE supports it.
Beta versions of Firefox, Safari and others may support downloadable
fonts. It has been a <em>long</em> time coming.</p>
<p>I originally designed this site for screens with 800&times;600
pixels or more. Today, browser statistics indicate that 1024&times;768
is a reasonable design resolution. I'm not going to redesign the site:
wide text columns are hard to read.</p>
<p>The site is designed for low-bandwidth and fast rendering. My
Mom&#8212;I kid you not&#8212;still uses dial-up in 2009. This page's
source file contains no format information, which consumes bandwidth.
Instead, it links to shared stylesheet and font files. &lt;p&gt; tags
inside the &lt;div.body&gt; block get rendered in Georgia, with the
spacing you see here. &lt;p&gt; tags inside the &lt;div.nav&gt; block
get rendered in Arial, with no inter-paragraph space. This reduces
bandwidth requirements, because your browser downloads the stylesheet
only once for all the pages on this site.</p>
<p>Modern browsers should display the title and body text rapidly
and before the navigation bar, rather than waiting for the whole page to
load (I wouldn't dream of making Mom wait). That is because this site
uses &lt;div&gt; tags with absolute positioning to separate major page
components, rather than &lt;table&gt; tags.</p>
<p>The <a href="contact.htm">Contact</a> page refers to a vCard that
can be downloaded directly into most contact managers. That vCard
required some configuration of MIME types on most web servers, which at
least partly explains why more people don't put vCards on their web
sites. Alas.</p>
<p>This site was originally developed with <a
	href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver
MX</a>, a professional web design tool produced by my former employer, <a
	href="http://www.macromedia.com" target="ext">Macromedia</a>. Fonts
were encoded using Microsoft <a
	href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/weft3/default.htm?fname=%20&amp;fsize=">WEFT</a>.
The site uses the XHTML 1.0 Transitional language, making it XML
compliant. I now edit using Eclipse's XML editing mode.</p>
<p>Hosting for this site has evolved with the internet market. This
site was originally hosted on a server at home, which required a
high-speed connection and a fixed IP number. I then moved it to an
inexpensive Java hosting site, <a href="http://www.4java.ca">4java.ca</a>.
Now it runs on the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google
App Engine</a>, which hosts lightweight Java and Python web applications,
free. Greetings from <a

            <h3> There's Gold in that Mountain of Data</h3>
            <h3> By Dan R. Greening </h3>
            <p></p>
            <p> (Copyright Web Techniques, 1999. To appear in January 2000 issue. 
              Reproduction is prohibited.)</p>
            <p>When visitors interact with your site, they provide information 
              about themselves and how they respond to your content: which links 
              visitors click, where they spend most of their time, which search 
              terms they use, and when they browse. Some visitors may even fill 
              out a lifestyle survey or provide names and addresses. Complex content 
              also contains important information, such as words in articles, 
              job descriptions and resumes, and features of competitive or complementary 
              products. All this information is often stored in a database.</p>
            <p> As a result, you have a lot of information on your Web visitors 
              and content, but you probably aren't making the best use of it. 
              Data warehouse reporting systems, such as those provided by traffic 
              analyzers, aggregate and report facts over different dimensions. 
              (See my article titled &quot;Tracking Users,&quot; Web Techniques, 
              July 1999.)</p>
            <p> These warehouse reporting systems are commonly called online analytic 
              processing (OLAP) systems. OLAP systems can report only on directly 
              observed and easily correlated information. They rely on you to 
              discover patterns and decide what to do with them. OLAP systems 
              won't tell you that people frequently buy potato chips, onion soup 
              mix, and sour cream at the same time, and they won't discover that 
              some people love any movie that contains an explosion. The information 
              is even too complex for humans to discover these patterns using 
              an OLAP system.</p>
            <p> To solve this problem, marketers and business analysts use data-mining 
              techniques. These are machine learning algorithms that find buried 
              patterns in databases, and report or act on those findings. There 
              are many data-mining techniques, and it's difficult for one person 
              to understand the entire field. The best we can do in one article 
              is provide an introduction to the problems that data-mining techniques 
              can solve, mention the techniques usually applied to those problems, 
              and give some insight into vendors offering solutions.</p>
            <h2> Know Your Visitor</h2>
            <p> To use data mining on your Web site, you have to establish and 
              record visitor and item characteristics, and visitor interactions.</p>
            <p> Visitor characteristics include demographics, psychographics, 
              and technographics. Demographics are tangible attributes such as 
              home address, income, purchasing responsibility, or recreational 
              equipment ownership. Psychographics are personality types that might 
              be revealed in a psychological survey, such as highly protective 
              feelings toward children (commonly called &quot;gatekeeper moms&quot;), 
              impulse-buying tendencies, early technology interest, and so on. 
              Technographics are attributes of the visitor's system, such as operating 
              system, browser, domain, and modem speed. If you have a phone number 
              or address, you can sometimes obtain household demographic or psychographic 
              information through direct marketing service providers, such as 
              Webcraft or Acxiom. Business demographics are available through 
              Dun &amp; Bradstreet.</p>
            <p> Item characteristics include Web content information-media type, 
              content category, URL-as well as product information-SKU (stock-keeping 
              unit, basically a product number), product category, color, size, 
              price, margin, available quantities, promotion level, and so on.</p>
            <p> Visitor statistics accumulate when visitors interact with items, 
              the Web site, or the company. Visitor-item interactions include 
              purchase history, advertising history, and preference information. 
              Purchase history is a list of products and purchase dates. Advertising 
              history indicates which items were shown to a visitor. Preference 
              information refers to item ratings provided by a visitor. Click-stream 
              information is a history of hyperlinks that a visitor has clicked 
              on. Link opportunities are hyperlinks that have been presented to 
              a visitor.</p>
            <p> Visitor-site statistics are typically per-session characteristics, 
              such as total time, pages viewed, revenue, and profit per session 
              with a visitor. Visitor-company information might include total 
              number of customer referrals from a visitor, total profit, total 
              page views, number of visits per month, last visit, and so on. Visitor-company 
              information can include brand measurements. Brand associations, 
              for example, are lists of positive or negative concepts a visitor 
              associates with the brand, which can be measured by surveying visitors 
              periodically. Permissions are attributes that a visitor provides 
              indicating how marketing information contributed by the visitor 
              can be used, such as permission to send email, to share information 
              with marketing partners, and so on.</p>
            <p> If you do nothing else in response to this article, I urge you 
              to do two things: First, decide how you might use information recorded 
              about your site's visitors, write a privacy statement, and make 
              that statement available on your Web site. See www.truste.org for 
              assistance. Think about privacy from the visitor's point of view. 
              Visitors prefer to view products and pages that interest them, so 
              they usually share information for that purpose. However, they typically 
              want you to ask for permission before sending them marketing email, 
              or sharing their contact information with partner companies. If 
              you provide a privacy statement documenting your intended uses, 
              and give visitors an email address for comments, your visitors will 
              let you know whether the policy is acceptable.</p>
            <p> Second, record the data now, even if you do not have a data-mining 
              process in place. You will find most data-mining tool vendors allow 
              for an initialization step in which they incorporate historical 
              data into your data-mining system.</p>
            <h2> List Your Goals</h2>
            <p> The great advantage of Web marketing is that you can measure visitor 
              interactions more effectively than in brick-and-mortar stores or 
              direct mail. Data mining works best when you have clear, measurable 
              goals. The following are some goals you might consider:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase average page views per session;</li>
              <li> Increase average profit per checkout;</li>
              <li> Decrease products returned;</li>
              <li> Increase number of referred customers;</li>
              <li> Increase brand awareness;</li>
              <li> Increase retention rate (such as number of visitors that have 
                returned within 30 days);</li>
              <li> Reduce clicks-to-close (average page views to accomplish a 
                purchase or obtain desired information);</li>
              <li> Increase conversion rate (checkouts per visit).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you've instrumented your site to record the visitor, content, 
              and interaction characteristics, and you've determined a set of 
              measurable marketing goals, congratulations! You are farther along 
              than most marketers. Now you can gain value from data mining.</p>
            <h2> Understand Your Problem</h2>
            <p> The first step to solving a problem is articulating the problem 
              clearly. Common problems Web marketers want to solve are how to 
              target advertisements, personalize Web pages, create Web pages that 
              show products often bought together, classify articles automatically, 
              characterize groups of similar visitors, estimate missing data, 
              and predict future behavior. All involve discovering and leveraging 
              different kinds of hidden patterns.</p>
            <p><b>Targeting</b>. Marketers use targeting to select the people 
              receiving a fixed advertisement, to increase profit, brand recognition, 
              or other measurable outcome. Targeting on the Web must account for 
              different advertising ad space costs. Web sites with valuable visitors 
              typically charge more for ad space.</p>
            <p> On sites where visitors register, advertisers can target on the 
              basis of demographics. For example, people living in different parts 
              of the country or visiting different Web sites may have differing 
              propensities to purchase sports-team-branded apparel, gay travel 
              tours, or discount car parts. Therefore, if you target the people 
              most likely to purchase your product, you can reduce your cost for 
              an ad campaign and increase the total profit.</p>
            <p> Some sites let you target ads on the basis of IP address, under 
              the theory that DNS registration information or surveys provide 
              the physical location of the IP address. However, because national 
              dial-up ISPs often share a pool of IP addresses, this is not a reliable 
              method. As we say in the business, &quot;Half the U.S. population 
              lives in Vienna, Virginia&quot; (AOL's corporate address).</p>
            <p> Data mining can help you select the targeting criteria for an 
              ad campaign. Web publications have a set of variables by which they 
              can target advertisements. By performing a test ad using &quot;run-of-site&quot; 
              (that is, untargeted) ad space you can associate demographic variables 
              with conversion. People &quot;convert&quot; when they accomplish 
              the marketing goal, such as performing a click-through, purchase, 
              registration, and so on. Data mining can identify the combination 
              of criteria that maximizes the profit. For example, data mining 
              might discover that targeting based on the logical expression</p>
            <blockquote> <code>(java-consultant) or (software-engineer and purchasing-authority 
              &lt; 10,000</code></blockquote>
            <p>will increase the click-through on a JavaBean banner ad.</p>
            <p> There is a huge variety of data-mining tools that support targeting, 
              because targeting is extensively used in direct mail marketing.</p>
            <p><b>Personalization</b>. Marketers use personalization to select 
              the advertisements to send to a person, to maximize some measurable 
              outcome. Here we use &quot;advertisement&quot; loosely to refer 
              to any recommendation or item offered by a site. Even a simple hyperlink 
              in a menu or an article could be considered an advertisement.</p>
            <p> Personalization is the converse of targeting. Targeting optimizes 
              the types of people that will see an advertisement, reducing cost 
              by showing the advertisement to more people in a broader campaign. 
              It is most useful for prospecting-finding people who haven't visited 
              your site yet-because there's a cost to advertising on outside Web 
              sites. But targeting is pointless on your own site, where advertisements 
              are free. Why would you not show your products to a person visiting 
              your own site?</p>
            <p> In contrast, personalization optimizes the advertisements that 
              a person sees, raising revenue because the person sees more interesting 
              stuff. Personalization can be used for external advertising, but 
              you're more likely to use it on your own site. External sites don't 
              usually give you enough information about individual visitors to 
              do good personalization.</p>
            <p> Some personalization systems, such as Broadvision One-to-One, 
              rely on the marketer to write rules for tailoring advertisements 
              to visitors. These are &quot;rules-based personalization systems.&quot; 
              If you have historical information, you can buy data-mining tools 
              from a third party to generate the rules. Rules-based personalization 
              systems are usually deployed in situations where there are limited 
              products or services offered, such as insurance and financial institutions, 
              where human marketers can write a small number of rules and walk 
              away.</p>
            <p> Other personalization systems, such as Andromedia LikeMinds, emphasize 
              automatic realtime selection of items to be offered or suggested. 
              Systems that use the idea that &quot;people like you make good predictors 
              for what you will do&quot; are called &quot;collaborative filters.&quot; 
              These systems are usually deployed in situations where there are 
              many items offered, such as clothing, entertainment, office supplies, 
              and consumer goods. Human marketers go insane trying to determine 
              what to offer to whom, when there are thousands of items to offer. 
              As a result automatic systems are usually more effective in these 
              environments. Personalizing from large inventories is complex, unintuitive, 
              and requires processing huge amounts of data.</p>
            <p><b>Association</b>. Also called market-basket analysis, association 
              identifies items that are likely to be purchased or viewed in the 
              same session. If you place references to these items together on 
              the same page in a Web catalog, you may remind your visitor to purchase 
              or view something otherwise forgotten. If you hold a promotion on 
              one item in an association group, you're likely to increase purchases 
              of other items in that group.</p>
            <p> Association can be deployed in situations even where you have 
              static catalog pages. In this case, you rely on the visitor to select 
              the first catalog page to view, and then serve up related items 
              as cross-sells. Association is the data-mining solution Amazon uses 
              when it says, &quot;Customers who bought The Grapes of Wrath also 
              bought The Great Gatsby.&quot;</p>
            <p><b>Knowledge Management</b>. These systems seek to identify and 
              leverage patterns in natural language documents. A more specific 
              term is &quot;text analysis,&quot; since the vast majority operate 
              on text. The first step is associating words and context with high-level 
              concepts. This can be done in a directed way by training a system 
              with documents that have been tagged by a human with the relevant 
              concepts. The system then builds a pattern matcher for each concept. 
              When presented with a new document, the pattern matcher decides 
              how strongly the document relates to the concept.</p>
            <p> This approach can be used to sort incoming documents into predefined 
              categories. Companies use this approach to build automatic site 
              indices for visitors. News and portal sites use this to reduce the 
              cost of categorizing and selecting news from syndicators. Some systems 
              also provide automatic summaries of key points, and cross-reference 
              documents to related material.</p>
            <p> Knowledge management systems can be used to personalize online 
              publications. Imagine a pattern matcher for the &quot;what Dan Greening 
              likes&quot; concept. This system would find new documents that contain 
              words and context also contained in articles that I've read before. 
              Products in this area include Autonomy and HNC SelectResponse.</p>
            <p> Knowledge management systems can assist in creating automatic 
              responses to help requests. For example, inbound requests to a customer-support 
              email address can be categorized, and an automatic response can 
              be sent from a library of FAQs. Vendors in this area include Kana 
              and eGain. (See the box &quot;Knowledge Management&quot; in the 
              November 1999 article &quot;You Asked For It: Solving the Customer 
              Support Dilemma.&quot;)</p>
            <p> One of the most interesting applications in this area is Abuzz 
              Beehive, which creates a &quot;knowledge network&quot; within a 
              community of experts. If you send a question to Beehive, it first 
              tries to find a good answer in its archive. If it doesn't have a 
              good answer, it redirects the question to an expert it thinks can 
              properly respond. If the expert does respond, it squirrels the response 
              away in case the question is asked again. In this way, it builds 
              up a permanent, adapting knowledge base. </p>
            <p> Abuzz has created something I find both exciting and spooky: a 
              more informative organism bred from machine and human. Beehive is 
              a computer broker that brings together human experts with different 
              specializations. Students of biology will note this parallels important 
              evolutionary events, such as the aggregation and differentiation 
              of single-celled organisms into more effective multicelled organisms.</p>
            <p><b>Clustering</b>. Sometimes called segmentation, clustering identifies 
              people who share common characteristics, and averages those characteristics 
              to form a &quot;characteristic vector&quot; or &quot;centroid.&quot; 
              Clustering systems usually let you specify how many clusters to 
              identify within a group of profiles, and then try to find the set 
              of clusters that best represents the most profiles.</p>
            <p> Clustering is used directly by some vendors to provide reports 
              on general characteristics of different visitor groups. These techniques 
              require training, and suffer from drift on Web sites with dynamic 
              Web pages. (Again, see the article &quot;Tracking Users,&quot; Web 
              Techniques, July 1999.) </p>
            <p><b>Estimation and Prediction</b>. Estimation guesses an unknown 
              value, such as income, when you know other things about a person. 
              Prediction guesses a future value, such as the probability of buying 
              a car next year, when a person hasn't done it yet, or the expected 
              number of stocks that a person will trade in the coming year. The 
              same algorithms can perform estimation and prediction.</p>
            <p> Estimation is often used in demographics to fill in the blanks. 
              If you don't know what income a person has, an estimator can identify 
              other variables that correlate well with income-such as location, 
              car preference, job title-then find other people with similar traits 
              and use them to estimate income and confidence value.</p>
            <p> Prediction can compute important future attributes of a person-such 
              as lifetime monetary value, next visit interval, learning speed, 
              promotion susceptibility, and so on-based on the same approach. 
              These values can be used in personalization applications.</p>
            <p> Marketers often aggregate information to understand groups of 
              customers. Even adding up or averaging past events over different 
              dimensions-such as visitor category, content category, referrer, 
              and time-can provide useful information. This simple aggregation 
              is called OLAP, online analytic processing: online because the marketer 
              uses an online reporting engine to interactively move through the 
              data; analytic because the marketer is passively looking through 
              past data, not trying to change it. </p>
            <p> Prediction can be applied in combination with OLAP techniques 
              to generalize properties of groups of people visiting a Web site. 
              This can help a marketer to slice and dice the data to find which 
              item attributes or site characteristics appeal to the most valuable 
              customers.</p>
            <p><b>Decision Trees</b>. A decision tree is essentially a flow chart 
              of questions or data points that ultimately leads to a decision. 
              For example, a car-buying decision tree might start by asking whether 
              you want a 1999 or 2000 model year car, then ask what type of car, 
              then ask whether you prefer power or economy, and so on, until it 
              determines what might be the best car for you. Decision tree systems 
              try to create optimized paths, ordering the questions so a decision 
              can be made in the least number of steps.</p>
            <p> Decision tree systems are incorporated in product-selection systems 
              offered by many vendors. They're great for situations in which a 
              visitor comes to a Web site with a particular need. But once the 
              decision has been made, the answers to the questions contribute 
              little to targeting or personalization for that visitor in the future. 
            </p>
            <p> For example, decision trees are used in the &quot;paper clip&quot; 
              office assistant in Microsoft Office: It watches what you click 
              on, and observes your mistakes. It may decide you need help and 
              bring up a help page with more information. Some of us find the 
              paper clip helpful. Others wish we could strangle it.*</p>
            <h2> Picking a Solution</h2>
            <p> Data mining isn't for the faint of heart. You face three major 
              problems. First, many good data-mining professionals are serious 
              nerds who speak the foreign language of statistics. Second, there 
              are few plug-and-play solutions. And third, everything useful is 
              expensive.</p>
            <p> I wrote this article to strengthen your resolve.</p>
            <p> The previous sections showed you how to determine the data you 
              should collect, the metrics you hope to improve, and the framework 
              of the problem. If you know these things, you can communicate more 
              fluently with data-mining professionals.</p>
            <p> Use caution when listening to traditional offline data-mining 
              professionals. It's likely that your Web site operates at a faster 
              rate, involves more data, and is more mission critical than anything 
              they've done. Traditionalists are familiar with a more relaxed world: 
              where data mining is used once per month, rather than once per click; 
              where data accumulates in gigabytes per year rather than gigabytes 
              per month; and where a crashed application needs to be fixed in 
              the morning, rather than instantly by redundant machines and fail-safe 
              rollover.</p>
            <p> Data-mining algorithms overlap in the problems they can solve, 
              but for a given problem there's usually a &quot;best algorithm.&quot; 
              When you buy a product, make sure the algorithm it uses is appropriate 
              for the task you're trying to perform. The box titled &quot;Picks, 
              Pans, &amp; Dynamite&quot; discusses the most common data-mining 
              techniques used on the Web.</p>
            <p> Though data-mining applications are expensive, everything is relative. 
              Andromedia's LikeMinds personalization system increased average 
              spend rate on the Levi-Strauss online store by 33 percent and increased 
              repeat visitation by 225 percent. This adds up to a lot of revenue.</p>
            <p> The world of Web data mining is simultaneously a minefield and 
              a gold mine. By saving data associated with visitors, content, and 
              interactions, you can at least ensure you'll be able use it later. 
              Despite the difficulties, you might consider evaluating and incorporating 
              data-mining applications now. The sooner you start learning from 
              your data, the sooner you can leave your competitors in the dust.

            <h1> Picks, Pans, &amp; Dynamite</h1>
            <h3>Data-Mining Algorithms </h3>
            <p>The data-mining algorithms used on the Web fall into several general 
              categories.</p>
            <p>Neural networks work something like your brain. When patterns are 
              presented to you, your brain eventually figures out that certain 
              patterns are associated with other desired outcomes. This can be 
              applied to targeting, estimation, prediction, and knowledge management. 
              Neural networks must be trained, sometimes taking hours of CPU time. 
              They don't adapt to new patterns until trained again, and they need 
              to be carefully tuned by a human.</p>
            <p>Collaborative filters organize profile data by person, then use 
              this logic: People who have done things you have done are good predictors 
              for what you will do. In a sense, they are a restricted type of 
              neural network, with the input data in a regular form. This restriction 
              gives collaborative filters three great advantages: They adapt rapidly 
              to new behavior patterns. They can predict for thousands of data 
              points simultaneously. And they don't need to be tuned. This makes 
              collaborative filters ideal for realtime personalization applications.</p>
            <p>Bayesian networks build a directed graph of conditional probabilities. 
              As a visitor provides more information about himself or herself, 
              a Bayesian network adjusts the probabilities of each possible end 
              result. This allows a Web system to accelerate the visitor's experience 
              by bringing the most likely things to the visitor's attention as 
              soon as possible. Bayesian networks are most appropriate to help 
              satisfy short-term visitor goals, such as answering customer support 
              questions, diagnosing problems, or selecting an appliance. However, 
              training a Bayesian network is often extremely slow. -DG</p>

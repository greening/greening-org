So let&#146;s get to the point, at least my point.  There are lots of benefits to personalizing your marketing efforts online.
</ul><ul>
By offering products better suited to each individual consumer, you&#146;re more likely to get them to buy from you.  Hence, more electronic commerce for you at not a very high cost.
</ul><ul>
Personalization is service, and consumers pay for service.  Why compete on margin?  Instead, give consumers a great shopping experience, then they buy from you even if it costs a little more.
</ul><ul>
Finally, when you give personalized service to your customers, they become more loyal to you.  I bought my last suit from Ken Kaiserman at Nordstrom, and I&#146;ll buy my next one from him too. He knows I like modern suits that I can squash into luggage, he remembers my name, he suggests great shoes.  I&#146;m a loyal customer.</ul> </p>

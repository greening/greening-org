      <p class="first">One-sentence summary: I'm a gregarious, outdoor-sports
        loving, art-appreciating, politically-savvy computer scientist,
        entrepreneur, consultant and writer.</p>
      <p>I like helping to organize people, teams, departments and companies
        to more effectively produce value. Creating highly productive groups
        through reorganization has been a driving theme in my life for over 20
        years.</p>
      <p>I am currently an agile product and marketing consultant, helping companies
        rapidly adapt to new market conditions and risks.</p>
      <p>From 2007 to 2012, I worked for Citrix Online as Director, Agile Program Office
        and User Experience. I worked with the heads of Engineering and Product
        Management to optimize developer effort, maximize value and satisfy new
        markets. I spearheaded the adoption of Scrum and other agile methods
        throughout the company, training over 200 people. During my 4-year
        tenure, Citrix Online raised its release rate by a factor of 5, and
        gained market share to become the number 2 provider of collaboration
        software.</p>
      <p>I have been involved in several software startups. Some gained
        liquidity, one did not. I also keep a toe in academia: I co-chair the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science Agile/Lean track with Jeff Sutherland. I was Principal
        Investigator on three National Science Foundation grants.</p>
      <p>I love to travel. This photo has a story: Overstock.com's CEO had a
        meeting in New York. Happy with our efforts to restructure his
        engineering department, he took Ron Lussier and me along in his jet
        (wow), and put us in a hotel facing Central Park. The snow was falling
        on <a href="http://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-gates">Christo's
          Gates</a>.</p>
      <p>When profession, recreation and creativity flow seamlessly, when I
        can't distinguish work from fun, that's when life is good.</p>

<p class="first">One-sentence summary: I'm a gregarious,
outdoor-sports loving, art-appreciating, politically-savvy computer
scientist, entrepreneur and writer.</p>
<p>I like helping to organizing people, teams, departments and companies to more effectively produce  value.
Creating highly productive groups through reorganization has been a
driving theme in my life for over 20 years.</p>
<p>I currently work for Citrix Online as Director, Agile Program Office. I
work with the heads of Engineering and Product Management to optimize
developer effort, maximize value and agilely identify and respond to new
markets.</p>
<p>I have been involved in several software startups. Some gained
liquidity, one did not. I also keep a toe in academia: I was Principal
Investigator on three National Science Foundation grants.</p>
<p>I love to travel. This photo has a story: Overstock.com's CEO had
a meeting in New York. Happy with our efforts to restructure his
engineering department, he took my collaborator/husband Ron Lussier and me along in his jet
(wow), and put us in a hotel facing Central Park. The snow was falling
on <a href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/tg.shtml">Christo's
Gates</a>.</p>
<p>When profession, recreation and creativity flow seamlessly, when
I can't distinguish work from fun, that's when life is good.</p>

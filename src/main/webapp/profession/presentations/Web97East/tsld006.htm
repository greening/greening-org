None of us can really stop supply chain integration, so if you can&#146;t beat &#145;em, join &#145;em.  Let&#146;s figure out what to do to help our pals integrate their supply chains faster than their competitors so we&#146;ll all win the game.
</ul><ul>
The passive approach says, &#147;OK, my company isn&#146;t ready to actively deploy something with our customers, but the minimum we should do is collect data.&#148; Can you merge web information with your direct mail lists?  You should integrate your web page with your other marketing efforts.  
</ul><ul>
Register your web page visitors and ask them for their customer number. Store the customer number in a cookie.  Then track the pages they visit on your site and the purchases they make, so later you&#146;ll have the information you need to personalize your site better.
</ul><ul>
The active approach says, &#147;Actively helping consumers will attract and keep them buying from us.&#148;  Now you exploit the information you&#146;re gathering to help suggest products to customers visiting your site and plan new inventory efforts.  Integrating with point-of-sale terminals allows you to provide personalized and targeted coupons that consumers will appreciate.</ul> </p>

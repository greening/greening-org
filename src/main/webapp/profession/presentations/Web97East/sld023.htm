We differ from other predictive modeling companies because we view every individual as a single market.  That means when you use our software to promote products or target marketing messages, you know that each individual is getting the promotions that are most likely to win her favor, and her business.
</ul><ul>
Other companies use segmentation or clustering to lump people together into large blocs, and then compute the average of what those people like to predict what they want.  The problem with segmentation is that you are not the average of the people you&#146;re sitting with right now.  Instead, probably the people you&#146;re sitting with right now share the same interests in technology or design, but probably your car buying patterns are all over the map.
</ul><ul>
Even worse, a lot of companies use demographic segmentation to predict what you&#146;ll buy.  Demographic segmentation says you&#146;re a 25 year old male executive living in the 95014 zip code making $120,000 a year, and therefore, you want the BMW Z3 roadster.  Well, I suppose it&#146;s better than nothing, but if you have buying information and our technology, you can do a lot better.</ul> </p>

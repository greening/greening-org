To show these concepts in action, let&#146;s talk about MovieCritic, the LikeMinds demonstration site.
</ul><ul>
MovieCritic suggests movies specific to your taste, not the taste of the average person.  Here&#146;s how it works.
</ul><ul>
You rate some movies, and WebSell stores those movie ratings in a database.
</ul><ul>
WebSell finds the people who best share your taste in movies: you liked Die Hard, they like Die Hard, you hated Total Recall, they hated Total Recall. It then weights each other person (we call these mentors), with a higher weight for people more like you.
</ul><ul>
To predict your interest in different  movie, WebSell  takes the people most like you and use their ratings as predictors for your ratings.
</ul><ul>
To provide recommendations, WebSell sorts the movies in order of how well it thinks you&#146;ll like the movie.  MovieCritic presents those movies in the Best Bets list.
</ul><ul>
Based on the strength of your relationship with your mentors, and the controversiality of a movie (or product, etc.) we can provide a &#147;confidence level&#148; for each prediction.  </ul> </p>

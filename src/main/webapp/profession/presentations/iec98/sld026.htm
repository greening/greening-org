And now we come to my favorite part.  You see, I believe in the power of communities to solve problems together.  Networked computers can help create communities without the constraints of physical space.  Furthermore, communities can help knit the world together into a more cohesive and happy whole&#151;a big interactive organism with functionally differentiated pieces, and those pieces are interacting communities.  Whoa, that&#146;s a little wild.  How did I get there from here?
</ul><ul>
Understanding historical trends helps us anticipate the future.  In the beginning, there was monopoly marketing.  You set up the general store, and people basically had to buy from you.  Then came competitors, and sitting around wasn&#146;t good enough.
</ul><ul>
Then there was mass marketing, where you put up a big billboard or sponsored a TV commercial.  Then the problem was you spent an enormous amount of money for a small number of people.
</ul><ul>
Now we have one-to-one marketing, where marketers try to understand you very well, and send you marketing messages that are perfect for you.  LikeMinds software does this very well.
</ul><ul>
But there are better ways to market.  We rely on friends to help us purchase products, and we like people who share our tastes.  What if computers could construct groups of likeminded people, say in a chat group, and then market products to the whole group simultaneously?  Then people in the community would see the advertisements as environmental cues for what they share in common, and then they talk about the cues.
</ul><ul>
If you think about it, this isn&#146;t too different from real life.  We look at the people in a restaurant to see if we would like it.  We go shopping with friends.  We go to Tupperware parties!</ul> </p>

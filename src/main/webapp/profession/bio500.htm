      <p>Dan
        Greening is a computer scientist currently focusing on adaptive location
        services. He is CEO of <a href="http://www.bigtribe.com/">BigTribe Corporation</a>,
        an internet software company focusing on location services and personalization.
        BigTribe has developed a unique adaptive personalization algorithm that
        recommends locations (restaurants, stores, parks, etc.) you'll enjoy
        visiting and services (taxis, movie tickets, restaurant reservations,
        prescription refills, etc.) you'll use. It works with connected devices,
        such as web browsers and cell phones, and disconnected devices, such
        as PDAs.      </p>
      <p>In 2002, Dr. Greening was chair of the <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/LIF/">Location
          Interoperability Forum</a>'s Standards  Group (now part of <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/" target="ext">Open
          Mobile Alliance</a>), which wrote the widely-adopted <a href="manuscripts/LIF%20TS%20101%20v3.0.0.pdf"> Mobile
          Location Protocol</a>. The Mobile Location Protocol allows middleware
          systems to transmit location information in a technology-neutral way.
          It can preserve privacy and permissions while roaming. It can represent
          location information in local coordinate reference systems, making
          it easier to use local maps and directories. These factors are key
          for deploying location services in mobile telephone systems.</p>
      <p>Dr. Greening was formerly Vice President of Engineering for <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia</a>,
        directing software architecture, engineering, documentation and quality
        assurance for LikeMinds and Aria, marketing tools that improve revenues
        and quantify traffic on web sites. LikeMinds is an adaptive personalization
        system providing click-stream and preference-based collaborative filtering
        and market basket analysis in real-time, also on highly-trafficked sites.
        LikeMinds helps maximize the revenue potential for each visitor, and
        strengthens one-to-one relationships with customers, increasing retention
        and reactivation rates. Greening designed the parallel-processing architecture
        for LikeMinds, making it more scalable and accurate than competitors.
        LikeMinds is now bundled with <a href="ibmWebSphere5-4.htm"> IBM's WebSphere
        Commerce Server</a>, where it displaced a well-entrenched competitor
        previously bundled with WebSphere.</p>
      <p><a href="ariaAdAge.htm">Aria</a> was a web traffic and ecommerce analyzer
        for highly-trafficked sites, such as the US Postal Service. Aria helped
        marketers discover key traffic patterns and modify web sites to improve
        overall effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Dr. Greening's background includes corporate and engineering management,
        market research, sales and technology. Prior to Macromedia, he was Founder
        and CTO of the LikeMinds company. Previously he was Founder and CEO of
        Chaco Communications, a 3D graphics software company that created <a href="http://ipw.internet.com/clients_servers/vrml/916162520.html">VR
        Scout</a>, one of the first VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)
        browsers, and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pueblo/">Pueblo</a> (now
        an open source application), a popular multi-user domain (MUD) client.
        Previously he headed the UNIX
        development team for Software Transformation Inc., bought by Novell in
        1990.</p>
      <p>Greening is a recognized expert in location services and collaborative
        filtering, quoted in <a href="http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=236">Directions</a>, <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00071C5D-5B9E-1C74-9B81809EC588EF21&pageNumber=1&catID=2">Scientific
        American</a>, BBC news, and InternetWeek.
        He has filed
        patents
        in the area of personalized marketing, and has published articles on
        collaborative filtering, simulated annealing, and parallel processing.
        He has been a regular contributor to Web Techniques magazine, discussing
        marketing and technology matters. Greening has Ph.D. (1995) and Masters
        (1987) degrees in computer science from UCLA, and a Bachelor's (1982)
        degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan.</p>

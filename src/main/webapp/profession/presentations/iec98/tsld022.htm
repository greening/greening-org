Whew.  Marketers and artists in the audience can breath a sigh of relief, we are now going back to the real world.
</ul><ul>
So now you think personalization is cool, you want to buy WebSell, but you forgot why.
</ul><ul>
Here&#146;s why:  Money.  Money and eyeballs.
</ul><ul>
WebSell personalization helps increase revenue and traffic on your site.
</ul><ul>
&#147;Good&#148; response rates according to direct marketers are between 2 and 5%.  Nobody does better than that.  WebSell can help you jump the barrier. 
</ul><ul>
Those additional consumers that WebSell brings you are essentially free, because there are no additional mailing costs, no additional administration costs, and no additional mailing list fees. 
</ul><ul>
Plus you get more people visiting your site.  We had one customer put a WebSell application at the bottom of a list of site features, then when the customer saw the site traffic figures, which showed WebSell attracting hundreds of times more page views than any other part of the site, the WebSell application got moved to the first choice on the home page.
</ul><ul>
We think you&#146;ll be impressed, too.</ul> </p>

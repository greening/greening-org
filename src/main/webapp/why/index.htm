      <p>Good personal relationships help make us happier and more effective.
        I've devoted much of my life to finding ways to strengthen and leverage
        relationships using computers. The first company I founded, Chaco Communications,
        devoted itself to creating simulated environments where people could
        meet online as virtual people. That company morphed into LikeMinds, which
        used similarities between people to adaptively recommend movies, music
        and books. I helped with a product called Aria, which aggregated traffic
        information to show usage patterns when millions of people visit a web
        site. I created a company, BigTribe, using mobile phones and locations
        to help bring people together. I'm very interested in networks of individuals,
      how those networks structure our lives, and how computers can help.
      </p>
      <p>I love people, and I have over 3000 people in my contacts list. I also
        love computer science, which requires me to carve out time to ignore
        people. Spam is a problem, and for me the danger is both commercial spam
        and personal spam. With many people in my network, the effects of forwarded
        jokes or online polls can be overwhelming. My solution is to insist that
        friends follow this rule: They may send me anything that they wrote themselves.
        They may forward one funny email per year. No online polls! The intended
        effect of this rule is to force people to be more creative rather than
        derivative.</p>
      <p>I love the outdoors. I grew up in rural Michigan, where teenage summers
        found me hoisting an aluminum canoe to the nearby Pine River and paddling
        around, catching carp and frogs, watching dragonflies zoom and mate,
        swimming under the Honeyoye Creek Bridge and collecting sheep bones.
        I wanted to assemble a full spinal column, but the vertebrae didn't come
        from the same sheep, so I could never make it work. Winters found me
        cross-country skiing, and bicycling my way through a snowy 4 mile paper
        route..</p>
      <p>In my twenties and thirties, I gradually got more wide-ranging. I backpacked
        Denali, Yosemite, White Mountains of New Hampshire, Isle Royale, Baja
        California, Sequoia, Olympic National Park and the North Cascades. While
        living in Los Angeles, I bought a junky Jeep, unbolted the hardtop, pulled
        off the doors and drove around in sunglasses. While at a Complex Systems
        summer school at the Santa Fe Institute, I drove my Jeep up the rugged
        Pipeline Drive in Los Alamos. If I wasn't a skinny geek, I actually might
        have looked cool. </p>
      <p>I met Ron when he offered, on a gay college activities email list, to
        take people caving. I offered to take him backpacking in return. A long,
        email-based relationship started there, eventually resulting in our meeting
        at the second Lesbian and Gay March on Washington, October 11, 1987.
        Ron took me caving in a muddy, winding cave called McClung's. I took
        him backpacking to the Grand Canyon, with friends Li-Whei Chen, Doug
        Trainor and Alen Amirkhanian. Many caving and backpacking trips with
        Ron ensued. After moving all over the country, not necessarily in synchrony,
        Ron and I moved in together in 1991. I love Ron because he's got a wild-streak,
        he's very creative, and, well, he's handsome and charming.</p>
      <p>Now, in my forties, I still play outside, but it's more time-limited.
        I snowboard in the winter, windsurf in the summer, sometimes with gonzo
        friend Dr. Jack Hodges or quiet friend Dr. Andy Fyfe. I day-hike and
        mountain bike. I dream about backpacking, but mostly I'm thinking about
        the good times I had with my friends.</p>
      <p>I love experiencing and creating art. My mother is an artist, calligrapher,
        graphic designer and former art professor. I grew up creating plaster
        sand castings, paintings, paper cutouts, picture books and weavings.
        I love complex, dramatic, curiosity evoking paintings, photography and
        calligraphy. Here are some favorites: <a href="../hempel_repairdeptII.jpg"> Repair
        Department II by Wes Hempel</a>, <a href="../salgado.jpg">Kuwait by Sebastiao
        Salgado</a>, <a href="../inca_sign_venezuela.jpg">Inca Sign Venezuela
        2000 by Ron Lussier</a>.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite art creations was Sherry Lewis Shrine, an installation
        Ron and I built for Burning Man 1998. This 8x8x16 foot puppet theater
        invited visitors to create their own puppets or put on a puppet show.
        Such contributions would be rewarded with a Bombay Sapphire Martini.
        We developed a complete branding campaign. The logo featured Lamb Chop,
        the puppet, holding a Martini glass. We produced brochures outlining
        the purpose of the shrine and recounting Shari Lewis's life. We created
        wooden coins that could be used to defer or trade Martini compensation.
        The logo appeared in huge form on all four sides of the theater, on the
        brochures and on the coins. On one the last day of Burning Man, our installation
        was protested by the Sock Liberation Organization (we believe this is
        the correct group name, however, participants disappeared into the semi-autonomous
        tribal area between Black Rock Desert and San Francisco). They shouted &quot;Save
        the Socks, Save the Socks!&quot; and demanded that people take off their
        socks. We videotaped most of the puppet shows.</p>
      <p>I am fiscally conservative, believing governments should have money
        before they spend it (but also thinking it is appropriate for governments
        to tax citizens to pay for common benefits). At the same time, I believe
        strongly in individual freedoms. At present, this makes me a &quot;new
        Democrat&quot;, but when Republicans were civil libertarians, such as
        during the emancipation of the slaves, I could have been a Republican.
        I tend not to believe what politicians say, but watch what they do. You
        can imagine what I think of George Bush, now providing us a $165 billion
        deficit, primarily resulting from his $1.5 trillion 10 year tax cut (do
        the math). I loved Bill Clinton, perhaps because I could care less who
        he slept with. </p>
      <p>At times I've been active in local and university governance. In 1995,
        I was elected President of the University of California Student Association--the
        student government body for all 9 UC campuses--where I led some of the
        efforts to divest the UC portfolio of South African stocks. Ultimately
        we succeeded, with the adoption of a UC Regents resolution in 1986 to
        divest interests in South Africa. I wrote some of the language of the
        Regents' resolution. Combined with efforts at other universities, we
        motivated the US Congress to pass the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act
        September 9, 1986 over President Reagan's veto. The Act prohibited U.S.
        trade and other economic relations with South Africa.</p>
      <p>Today in many states and communities, lesbians and gays can live comfortable,
        open lives free of most overt discrimination. However, family law is
        not so equal. Regarding inheritance taxes, medical visitation rights
        and adoption law, gay couples in most states face special hurdles. When
        I ran for UC Student Association President in 1985, some students voted
        against me solely because I was gay. Discrimination continues, but thankfully
        it's down to a dull roar.</p>

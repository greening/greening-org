The preference server, which is at the heart of the WebSell application, predicts preferences, ratings, and web site behaviors.  In this case, we are showing how it predicts movie ratings in MovieCritic.
</ul><ul>
Smith likes Star Wars, really likes the Untouchables, has no opinion of Beverly Hills Cop, really likes Fletch and thought Caddyshack was so-so.
</ul><ul>
Note that Jones and Smith place Star Wars and the Untouchables in different relative ranks, while Jones and Wesson rank them relatively the same (Star Wars over the Untouchables).  Also note that Jones and Wesson have three movies rated in common, while Smith and Jones only have two.  The preference server algorithm takes both factors  into account, and so gives the relationship between Jones and Wesson a strong weight (10.6), while giving the Jones-Smith relationship a weak rank.
</ul><ul>
Then prediction vectors are constructed for each person.  Jones gets predictions primarily from Wesson, however note that Wesson&#146;s &#147;radical&#148; ratings (high and low) get mapped into Jones&#146; mild-mannered optimism range.</ul> </p>

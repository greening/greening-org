<h1>muted notes heard in a forest</h1>

<p><img src="forest.GIF" align="right" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="473"> isn't it strange, this place has no shelter <br>
no god here in this forest hushed quiet. <br>
all trees tall, almost wordless, separate <br>
hesitant breeze whispers glories promised </p>

<p>leaves shake threat with ancient practiced routine <br>
shadow boxing distant foes imagined. <br>
fine wind flows around softened gravestones <br>
warm air speech cleansing gruesome histories. </p>

<p>storm sky darkens with false god trust vapor <br>
battle blessed with death strength religious. <br>
blood lust conflict, ghostly human drama <br>
sanguine rivers wash in a red mist future. </p>

<p>equalized dust, the old man sighed sadly <br>
cursing bayonet-murder aggression <br>
patriotic child sought honor final <br>
a prideful pine box brought hollow cargo. </p>

<p>siren song with a foreign vibrato <br>
thinned this woodlot of strong trees listening. <br>
leaf matted sleep, butchered body stasis <br>
sexy voices breathe hymns mysterious. </p>

<p>barren solice for a broken father <br>
living past thoughts, climbing the old path worn <br>
tripping up on fallen lumber decay <br>
discarded birth, warfare machinery. </p>

<p>earth-bed solid, loving moist dirt mother <br>
accept these gifts, conquered offspring humbled. <br>
soil depressions will feed rising saplings <br>
sinister choirs sing lullabies, waiting. </p>

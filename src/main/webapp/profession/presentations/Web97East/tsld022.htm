DirectSell is the offline version of WebSell.  It targets products to individuals based on buying history, using similar algorithms to those found in WebSell.
</ul><ul>
The differences between DirectSell and WebSell center around the types of data typically available.  Where WebSell can get  a lot of negative data, &#147;you didn&#146;t go to the blouse section,&#148; in many cases, DirectSell gets no negative information, but just &#147;you bought Jungle Red lipstick&#148;.  DirectSell typically deals with binary data: you either bought it or you didn&#146;t.  
</ul><ul>
DirectSell mines existing sales history databases, then predicts which products are most likely to be purchased by an individual.
</ul><ul>
DirectSell applies to direct mail and telesales operations, helping salespeople &#147;up sell&#148;, where you buy the broach and the salesperson suggests the stickpin, and in &#147;cross selling&#148;, where furniture purchases suggest kitchenware.</ul> </p>

To personalize a web site or web catalog, you can use LikeMinds WebSell.  WebSell is a &#147;collaborative filter&#148;, which means it helps you find the items best for you by looking at what other people like you liked.
</ul><ul>
WebSell stores consumer preferences, behaviors, and purchases in a database, or can use your existing database. When asked to personalize a page for you, it finds people like you in the database (relations), then finds what they responded to, then predicts what you will like and recommends those. 
</ul><ul>
WebSell provides customer specific product recommendations, predicted satisfaction, and products for two or more.
</ul><ul>
What can you do with that information?  You can highlight products from a catalog that a customer will be more likely to buy.  You can order web pages in a menu in the order most appealing to the visitor.  You can suggest products that will satisfy a whole family or a couple.
</ul><ul>
Finally, WebSell can create groups of likeminded consumers.  That allows you to market products to a whole group, in a chat area for example.  The products being marketed are a cue for what the group shares in common.  So what do you think they&#146;ll use as the icebreaker?</ul> </p>

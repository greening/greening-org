 <h1>Massive Data: What can you do?</h1> 
 <p><ul>
<h2>Passive: Collect consumer data
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Store product and customer info in databases
<li>Integrate offline and online customer info
<li>Use cookies, track activity by person/product
<li>Track opportunities they didn&#146;t try
</ul></ul><ul>
<h2>Active: Build consumer base now
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create personalized experiences automatically
<li>Promote products customers will buy
<li>
<li>
</ul></ul></p>

Of course, the passive approach is pretty obvious: save the data.
</ul><ul>
The active approach is the same as before: exploit the data.  Just like the supply chain integration active approach.
</ul><ul>
It shouldn&#146;t surprise you  that dealing with the trend toward saving massive amounts of data suggests similar activities as the trend toward supply chain integration.  Both are different manifestations of the same phenomenon.  
</ul><ul>
Supply chain integration gives you direct access to consumer data.  Having access to direct data from consumers means data is less aggregated, more specific, more voluminous, and higher quality.</ul> </p>

There&#146;s another trend in the consumer world, and that&#146;s massive data collection.  Companies are saving a lot of data, then getting headaches thinking about how they can store it long-term.
</ul><ul>
What kind of data are companies saving?  Purchase data, of course.  And they&#146;re also getting and saving demographic information when you fill out warranty cards on new purchases. On the web, companies can save behavior and preference information.
</ul><ul>
Unfortunately, a lot of companies are throwing data away too.  And some important information never gets stored on a computer.  For example, when a company sends out a catalog, very few save the SKU numbers of the products being offered.  Some companies throw away information about which products were returned, as if no purchase was made.
</ul><ul>
All of this information has future value.  Saving it is a good idea, because it can help your company provide better service to your customers.</ul> </p>

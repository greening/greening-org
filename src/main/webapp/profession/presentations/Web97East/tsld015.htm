Here&#146;s the prediction screen I got when I clicked on &#147;Sling Blade&#148;.  Moralistic me got the prediction &#147;Loved It&#148; for Sling Blade, two points higher than the average person in the system.

If you look down below, you see a target with an arrow.  There are three rings and one bullseye in the target.  In this example, the arrow is in the third ring, very close to &#147;on target&#148;, which would be in the bullseye.

LikeMinds is very interested in accurate predictions.  We have a system that allows us to determine how accurate our predictions are, by using your ratings as sample points.
</ul><ul>
MovieCritic has a 13 point scale, with &#147;Loved It&#148; being 13 and &#147;Hated It&#148; being 1.  When the arrow is in the bullseye, our prediction is within 1 point of your actual rating 90% of the time.  In other words, our high confidence predictions are within 7% of actual 90% of the time.  Pretty darn good.
</ul><ul>
It keeps getting better, because we are continually testing and refining our methods.</ul> </p>

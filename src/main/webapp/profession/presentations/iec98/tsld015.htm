Here&#146;s a little agenda for the next few slides.
</ul><ul>
I&#146;m going to get down into the technology to describe roughly what we do. 
</ul><ul>
This section describes the algorithm from our patent applications. However, we are now using more sophisticated prediction algorithms than our patents discuss.  If you want to talk statistics, we can discuss that offline.
</ul><ul>
I&#146;ll then show how we compute our own accuracy based on your ratings.
</ul><ul>
Then I&#146;ll show how our &#147;archetypes&#148; can predict accuracy based on categories, which helps people get recommendations for new products that no one has ever rated before.
</ul><ul>
Finally, I&#146;ll talk about our parallel processing model.
</ul><ul>
The material in this section is drawn from our two issued patents (which you can find on our web site), or from recent patent filings.

    2.1</a></em>, LikeMinds, Inc. (October 22, 1997).</span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>LikeMinds WebSell is a patented collaborative filtering system that uses consumer
      product preferences to make highly specific recommendations. WebSell increases site
      traffic and response rates dramatically. It includes several innovations: Its built-in
      cross-validation system allows marketers to measure improvements when then tune system
      parameters. It can recommend products that have never been rated using
      &quot;archetypes,&quot; solving the cold start problem. Its parallel processing model is
      highly efficient and provides nearly linear speed-up with increased processors. LikeMinds
      WebSell is demonstrated at the web site <a href="http://www.moviecritic.com/">http://www.moviecritic.com/</a>.</p>

    <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Daniel R. Greening, <em><a href="phd.ps.gz">Simulated
    Annealing with Error</a>s</em>, Ph.D. Dissertation, UCLA, 1995. </span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Simulated annealing is a popular algorithm which produces near-optimal solutions to
      combinatorial optimization problems. It is commonly thought to be slow. Errors caused by
      approximate cost-functions (common in VLSI placement) and parallel algorithms increase
      speed, but degrade the outcome.</p>
      <p>This dissertation offers three contributions: First, it presents a taxonomy of parallel
      simulated annealing techniques, organized by state-generation and cost function
      properties. Second, it describes experiments that show an inverse correlation between
      calculation errors and outcome quality. Third, it proves these analytical results about
      annealing with inaccurate cost-functions: 1) Expected equilibrium cost is exponentially
      affected by \gamma/<em>T</em>, where \gamma quantifies cost-function range-errors and <em>T</em>
      gives the temperature. 2) Expected equilibrium cost is exponentially affected by
      (\highvar-\lowvar)/2<em>T</em>^2, when the errors have a Gaussian distribution. 3)
      Constraining range-errors to a constant factor of <em>T</em> guarantees convergence when
      annealing with a 1/log <em>t</em> temperature schedule. 4) Constraining range-errors to a
      constant factor of <em>T</em> guarantees a predictable outcome quality, when annealing a
      fractal space with a geometric temperature schedule, in polynomial time. 5) Inaccuracies
      worsen the expected outcome, but more iterations can compensate.</p>
      <p>Annealing applications should restrict errors to a constant factor of temperature.
      Practitioners can select a desired outcome quality, and then use the results herein to
      obtain a temperature schedule and an ``error schedule'' to achieve it.</p>

    Granularity in Data Flow Programs</em></a>, Masters Thesis, UCLA, 1988. </span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The execution time of a data flow program depends on the parallelism available, the
      resource requirements of the program, and the resources provided by the system.
      Communication delays between actors in a data flow graph significantly degrade
      performance. We can reduce these delays by partitioning actors into large sequential
      blocks. This thesis provides a method for optimally partitioning static cyclic data flow
      graphs into sequential blocks, when we know transition probabilities and communication
      delays, to reduce overall execution time.</p>
      <p>A structural model of data flow programs, called a ``probabilistic data flow graph,''
      provides a mathematical base. We provide a method for converting probabilistic data flow
      graphs to Markov chains. We provide an algorithm to give the set of all maximal sequential
      partitionings for a data flow graph. Selecting an optimal partitioning from this set, when
      transition probabilities are not fixed, is incomputable. When transition probabilities are
      fixed and known, we use Markov analysis to select the optimal partitioning. We discover
      that suboptimal partitionings provide a nearly optimal speedup.</p>
      <p>We show two sample data flow programs, apply our algorithms, and discuss the advantages
      and disadvantages of the method based on the examples. </p>

    of the 1989 ACM/IEEE Workshop on Applied Computing</em>, pp. 170-176.</span> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A unique moderated USENET newsgroup, sci.med.aids, hosts an electronic discussion of
      medical, social, ethical and political issues associated with AIDS. After 18 months of
      operation, sci.med.aids claims a worldwide readership of about 10,000 people.
      Physically-separated experts control sci.med.aids editorial policy through a democratic
      process. Moderation team members propose changes, debate, and vote through electronic
      mail.</p>
      <p>Within the team, members take on distinct roles. A chief moderator handles most
      editorial tasks. Expert technical contributors may post technical articles directly,
      bypassing the overhead of moderation. One member posts a Monthly AIDS Summary to
      sci.med.aids and related USENET newsgroups.</p>
      <p>Moderation has become less controversial and policy debate has receded. In response,
      sci.med.aids may begin using a new moderator scheme, which spreads editorial tasks over
      all team members.</p>
      <p>Sci.med.aids regularly includes Centers for Disease Control AIDS statistics, an
      electronic copy of the biweekly AIDS Treatment News newsletter, National Institutes of
      Health AIDS-related news releases, and a monthly calendar of AIDS conferences and events.
      It now has two network gateways--the AIDS LISTSERV gateway, and the sci.med.aids FidoNet
      gateway.</p>
      <p>This paper briefly reviews normal USENET moderation, presents the formation and current
      structure of sci.med.aids, analyzes problems encountered, and discusses the advantages and
      disadvantages of team moderation. The paper concludes with recommendations for others
      interested in forming team-moderated newsgroups, bulletin boards, or electronic magazines.</p>
      <p>Team moderation seems best suited for high-volume, controversial topics, where no
      single individual can have panoramic expertise. While sci.med.aids began as an experiment
      and occasional problems still appear, its large readership and high-quality articles
      attest to its overwhelming success. </p>

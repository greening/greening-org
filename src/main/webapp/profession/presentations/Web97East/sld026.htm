Here are some alternatives to collaborative filtering, which are appropriate in different circumstances.
</ul><ul>
The easiest personalization approach to take is called &#147;objective filtering.&#148;  In this case, the consumer selects explicitly which item categories to suggest.  Objective filtering is great for goal-based searches, or where there are some objective characteristics that directly relate to a consumers interest.  However, in most consumer areas such objective characteristics are hard to define.  How do you define &#147;wild colors&#148; for cosmetics, or &#147;good writer&#148; for books, or &#147;conservative but intriguing&#148; for clothing?  When the words people use to describe their favorite things differs from the categories used to file data, objective filtering won&#146;t work as well as other techniques.
</ul><ul>
Bayesian networks try to predict how you will behave based on your past behavior, using guesses about the relationship between past and future behavior.  If you hear data-mining folks talk about &#147;auto-regression,&#148; this is a very simple case of Bayesian analysis.  Rule-based predictions, such as learning agents, are Bayesian.  Bayesian techniques are great for goal-directed behavior where navigation is required (and tells the system approximately where you&#146;re trying to go) before accomplishing your goal.  So, online customer support sites, or automatic help applications are perfect for this.
</ul><ul>
Neural networks are a statistical technique like collaborative filtering, but a little less direct and a little more complex.  Neural networks work like your brain in attempting to identify patterns in data.  Every neural network is different, so one particular networks might not be appropriate for the data you have.  Anyway, here are some gross generalizations about neural networks when applied to marketing data: 1) you usually have to aggregate the data into 20 to 30 quantities before presenting it to a neural network. 2) neural networks typically don&#146;t deal well with periodicity (such as seasonalism) in data. 3) Frequently marketers use neural networks in combination with demographics (a surrogate that incurs its own inaccuracies).  4) Neural networks aren&#146;t reversible:  I.e., you can&#146;t figure out exactly which training sources caused the outcome you got.
</ul><ul>
Neural networks are great for data that comes in different quantities or units, such as trying to predict whether you will buy Cosmopolitan magazine by looking at how many books you bought last year in combination with your latitude.  If there&#146;s a pattern in such data, neural nets can find it.
</ul><ul>
The LikeMinds technique works best when a user generates  data in different categories which have similar units (such as &#147;loved it=12, hated it=1&#148; or &#147;how many visits to page category X&#148; or &#147;how many units sold of SKU number Y&#148; or &#147;bought/didn&#146;t buy SKU number Z&#148;).  We find most purchase behavior data is in this form.  Certainly web information is typically in this form.</ul> </p>

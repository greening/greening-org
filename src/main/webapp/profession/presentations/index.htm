    <small>Dan Greening</small><br>
    <small>Web97 East, Washington, DC, October 1, 1997</small></a></p>
    <p><small>This talk begins with a discussion of market forces driving online commerce. All
    elements of the supply chain are beginning to deploy personalization and target marketing.
    I discuss personalization/targeting technology in general, with a focus on how LikeMinds
    technology fits into the personalization picture.&nbsp; Then I discuss LikeMinds
    technology innovations in specific, and compare that technology to alternatives.</small></p>
    <small><p><a href="iec98/index.htm">Direct Marketing on the Web</small><br>
    <small>Dan Greening</small><br>
    <small>Internet and Electronic Commerce 98, New York, April 27, 1998</small></a></p>
    <p><small>This talk discusses the nature of direct marketing off and on the web. Targeting
    is important for direct mail, while personalization is essential for internet marketing. I
    begin by discussing direct marketing functions for mail campaigns and show how targeting
    and personalization play a role. I then discuss direct marketing for web applications, and
    show that targeting is relatively unimportant.&nbsp; Three forms of personalization are
    commonly used: rule-based, Bayesian, and collaborative personalization.&nbsp; I discuss
    collaborative personalization in detail, showing how LikeMinds overcame speed problems
    using a unique parallel processing mechanism.&nbsp; I then summarize by discussing our
    experience with MovieCritic, our experimental test-bed for online marketing ideas.</small></td>

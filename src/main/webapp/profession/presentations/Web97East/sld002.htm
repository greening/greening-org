There are two kinds of consumer marketing going on today, direct marketing and retail mass marketing.  Today I&#146;m going to be talking mostly about direct marketing.  However, many of the characteristics of direct marketing also apply to mass marketing.
</ul><ul>
Direct marketers are companies that send you snail mail, email and telesales calls to try to get you to buy something. To hear them talk, direct marketers know everything about you and what you are likely to buy.  Right?  Wrong.
</ul><ul>
Why do you get those Publishers Clearing House mailers, when you never respond?  Why do you throw out half the mail you get, before even opening the envelopes?  Because they don&#146;t do such a hot job of figuring out what you like.
</ul><ul>
Direct marketers made over $371 billion dollars last year in the United States.  And they spent $46 billion dollars on their marketing efforts, 12.5% of their gross revenues.  They got an average of about 3% response rate on their efforts.  That means a tiny improvement in response rate can reap many millions or billions of dollars.</ul> </p>

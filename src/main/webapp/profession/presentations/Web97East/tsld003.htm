So the goal of most direct marketers should be to get a better bang for their buck:  improve the response rate by anticipating consumer taste and marketing to that taste.  
</ul><ul>
If you can customize the message to each consumer, we call that &#147;personalization.&#148; Personalization is something the web is uniquely positioned to do well. You can also do it in telesales, where you might up-sell&#151;suggest to a caller buying a broach that they might also want to buy the cubic zirconium stick pin.
</ul><ul>
Targeting is the flip side of personalization&#151;it&#146;s where we take an existing marketing message and send it only to those consumers most likely to respond.
</ul><ul>
Finally, all marketers, both direct marketers and mass marketers, want to distribute their inventory as effectively as possible to get the greatest turnover.
</ul><ul>
If you do a good job at personalization, targeting and distribution, you get a much higher response to your marketing, and therefore take home a lot more in profits.
